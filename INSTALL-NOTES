INSTALLATION NOTES.
===================

The current Python version being used for development is 3.8.5.

Note that GLaDOS requires the following optional Python packages
to have previously been installed:


    Used by gpt3.api module:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        pip3 install openai             (I'm currently using vers. 0.27.0)
        pip3 install backoff            (I'm currently using vers. 1.10.0)
        pip3 install tiktoken           (I'm currently using vers. 0.2.0)


    Used by the config package:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        pip3 install hjson              (I'm currently using vers. 3.0.2)
            (Needed to parse config files.)


    Used by the infrastructure.time module:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        pip3 install python-dateutil    (I'm currently using vers. 2.8.2)
            (Needed to get time zone abbreviations right.)


ALSO NOTE: You have to install a GPT-2 directory tree (except model weights) to use the tokenizer; see instructions in src/tokenizer/README.md
    ^-- Except we are in the process of migrating away from this to use tiktoken.
