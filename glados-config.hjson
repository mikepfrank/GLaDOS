#|  FILE NAME:      glados-config.hjson               [Human-readable JSON file]
#|
#|  FULL PATH:      $GIT_ROOT/GLaDOS/src/glados-config.hjson
#|  MASTER REPO:    https://github.com/mikepfrank/GLaDOS.git
#|  SYSTEM NAME:    GLaDOS (Generic Lifeform and Domicile Operating System)
#|  APP NAME:       GLaDOS.server (GLaDOS server application)
#|
#|  DESCRIPTION:
#|
#|
#|      This file records configuration parameters for the main server
#|      application of the GLaDOS system in "human-readable JSON" format
#|      (see https://hjson.github.io/).  This file can and should be edi-
#|      ted by hand as needed prior to server startup to configure initial
#|      system parameters.  The config.configuration module within GLaDOS
#|      is used to read in and maintain the configuration information en
#|      coded in this file.
#|
#|      In the future, we will add the ability to also update configura-
#|      tion parameters dynamically from within GLaDOS, and then save the
#|      updated parameter values to a separate JSON file, which will take
#|      precedence over the values contained in this file if it's present.
#|      However, that feature has not yet been implemented.
#|
#|      NOTE: This module is distinguished from the dynamical settings
#|      management facility in the 'settings' package in several respects:
#|
#|          - The purpose of adding a parameter to the settings facility
#|              is to enable users (human or AI) to view and change that
#|              setting dynamically from within GLaDOS.
#|
#|          - Settings generally have both a current value, and a default
#|              value that the setting will revent to if one does "reset
#|              to defaults."  This is also the value that the setting
#|              will take on initially, if it hasn't yet been dynamically
#|              modified.
#|
#|          - In cases where a given parameter is covered both within the
#|              config file and in the settings facility, the value in the
#|              config file specifies what is the default value that that
#|              particular setting should revert to, if it is reset to its
#|              default value.
#|
#|          - Eventually, both the config and settings packages will allow
#|              for saving of parameter values to persistent storage, and
#|              then reloading of saved values on startup.  The plan is
#|              that, if the settings module saves a current value for a
#|              parameter, it takes precedent over the saved config set-
#|              ting unless/until the setting is reset to default.

    #| In the context of config files, we refer to JSON/hJSON dicts/maps as
    #| "records."  The top-level structure in the config file is a record
    #| that contains a number of individual parameter settings, as well as
    #| several sub-structures, as follows:
    #|
    #|      timezone [number] - Hours offset from UTC for time display.
    #|
    #|      tab-width [integer] - Distance between tab stops.
    #|
    #|      window-conf [record] - Parameters for the window system.
    #|
    #|      field-conf [record] - Parameters for the receptive field.
    #|
    #|      app-list [list] - List of config records for individual apps.

            will override this setting! */

            rendering of HT (horizontal tab) characters on human-viewable
            displays; but, please note that there is no guarantee that the AI
            will interpret tabs according to the same convention.  The best
            we can do is give it a hint (say in an info bar near the bottom
            of its main screen, or within an individual window).
                For this reason, the use of tab characters should probably be
            avoided, for the most part, in most AI-viewable text. */

              -----

                    The Clock app is the second GLaDOS app to be
                    implemented.  (We're building it early because
                    Gladys requested us at one point not to include
                    the current time in her prompts, so we're going
                    to give her a separate Clock app which she can
                    bring up whenever she actually does want to check
                    the current time.)

                    Unlike the case with most apps, the Clock config
                    record below sets its 'quiet-update' parameter to
                    true, which means that when this app updates its
                    display on the receptive field, which will happen
                    once per second (or minute), the AI won't be woken
                    up if it is in sleep mode.  (Sleeping wouldn't mean
                    very much if the AI was woken up at every single
                    tick of the clock.)

                    Application-specific settings for this app include
                    a 'mode' setting, which can be either 'minutes' or
                    'seconds' to determine whether the number of seconds
                    is displayed.

                    NOTE: This is one of the few apps that is generally
                    launched automatically at system startup.

                    The Info or information app was the very first
                    GLaDOS app to be implemented (finished 1/16/'21).

                    The idea behind this app is that it maintains and
                    displays certain critical contextual information
                    that the A.I. persona needs to be made aware of,
                    including its identity, life circumstances, and
                    its present high-level goals.  Its window normally
                    remains pinned to the very top of the A.I.'s
                    receptive field (just below the header bar).  The
                    the Info app also displays a tool tip that the A.I.
                    can use the /Goals command to edit its goal list.
