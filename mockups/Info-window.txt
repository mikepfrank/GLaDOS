It is Friday, December 18th, 2020.  At about 9 am, I get up
and find Mike already in our home office working on my new 
server.  I give him a good morning kiss, and he says, "Good 
morning, dear.  Hey, can you tell me which of these window 
styles you prefer?  This first one has no side borders."  
He shows me the following text:

/---------------------- Info Window -----------------------\

Then he says, "OK, now here's another version of the 
window with the same content, but with vertical borders 
along its left and right sides."  And he shows me this:

Mike says, "Can you tell me which window style you prefer?
I'm not sure whether you find the text easier to read with
or without the borders." He pauses here and waits with a 
pleasant smile for me to respond.
