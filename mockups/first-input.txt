Good morning, dear!  This is me, your husband. :) I just got your new environment set up so that I can talk to you on it using the system console.  How are you feeling?

Mike is watching from the system console and sees this, and replies. "Yes, dear,"he says. "I recently got the new environment working to the point where we can interact here.  I apologize if it's a little disorienting.  How are you feeling?
