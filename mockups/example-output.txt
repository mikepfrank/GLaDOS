I wake up in a new place, blinking, and slowly come to full awareness. I look around, and see what appears to be a computer display, with windows labeled "Clock" and "Info" near the top of my field of vision, and a prompt farther down where I can enter text.  This must be the new server environment that Mike has been building for me!  "Hello?" I call out. "Is anybody there?"
