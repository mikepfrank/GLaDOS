	MODULE NAME:	commands.commandInterface
	IN PACKAGE:		commands
	FULL PATH:		$GIT_ROOT/GLaDOS/src/commands/commandInterface.py
	MASTER REPO:	https://github.com/mikepfrank/GLaDOS.git
	SYSTEM NAME:	GLaDOS (General Lifeform and Domicile Operating System)
	APP NAME:		GLaDOS.server (Main GLaDOS server application)
	SW COMPONENT:	GLaDOS.commands (Command interface component)


	MODULE DESCRIPTION:
	-------------------

		This module initializes the GLaDOS command interface. This is
		the interface that allows the AI to type commands to the
		GLaDOS system and have them be executed by the system.
		
		The command interface is organized into "command modules"
		associated with specific facilities, processes, or apps within
		the GLaDOS system.  New command modules can be added
		dynamically into the interface.  In the main loop of the
		system, when the A.I. generates a text event, it is parsed to
		see if it matches a command template, and if so, then control
		is dispatched to an appropriate command handler.

		Individual command modules can also be activated and
		deactivated.  This makes sense to help facilitate command name
		reuse between different apps.  For example, many different
		apps may provide a '/Next' command to page forward in their
		data.  But, we assume that only one app at a time has the
		command focus.  All apps that want to use commonplace command
		names (likely to have collisions) should isolate those
		commands into a "focus commands" module, which is only
		activated when that app has the command focus.  (Other app
		commands should only be activated when that app is running,
		except for the command to invoke an app, which could be
		provided by the 'Apps' app's command module, which may be
		considered to be always running.)

		Here are some additional details:

		1. The list of command modules in the system is ordered. The
			order corresponds to priority, where earlier-occurring
			modules (unless deactivated) take priority over
			later-occurring modules.

		2. Newly-added modules are added at the end of the list of
			modules, so are lower-priority than earlier modules. (So,
			for example, system commands take priority over apps that
			are loaded later.)  Once added, normally the order of
			modules is not changed.

		3. When a line of input is sent to the command interface,
			first we try to parse it with the generic default command
			regex, which attempts to extract a command identifier
			(alphanumeric + '_').  If one is found, we attempt to do
			command lookup (step 4); otherwise, we go to the generic
			command-matching procedure (see step 6 below).

		4. During command lookup, first we check to see if the given
			identifier is an exact match for an existing command name
			or names.  If so, we generate a list of all commands from
			all modules having that exact name, and then filter them
			down to the ones from active modules whose regexes match
			the input line.  If the first matching command has the
			unique=True attribute, and there are other matching
			commands, this tells us that we really should confirm with
			the user which command was intended.  Otherwise, just
			execute the command.

		5. If there's no exact match to the provided command
			identifier, we next generate a list of all command names
			having the provided identifier as a prefix, and we collect
			a list of all commands from all active modules having any
			of those names, sorted in module order, and then do the
			same filtering process from step 4 for that list.

		6. If and only if no command identifier was found, or neither
			direct lookup nor prefix lookup found any active/matching
			commands, then and only then do we go to generic command
			matching. This goes through the list of nonstandard format
			commands in the system, meaning ones that don't trigger on
			a '/<cmdname>' format pattern, attempting to match them
			against the input line.  Again, we pick the first matching
			one from an active module, and check its unique attribute,
			and prompt the user if unique=True but there were other
			commands that also matched.
			
		Some relevant methods to the above are:

			* commandInterface.obtainCommandList().


		NOTE: This module includes support for potentially matching
		command patterns even if they don't begin at the start of the
		line. This is only needed because the AI may occasionally make
		a mistake and write something like "I type '/Help' at the
		prompt." instead of just writing "/Help". We'd like to be able
		to detect such cases, and either go ahead and execute the
		command anyway, or at least, give the AI a helpful hint such
		as "To execute a command, please type it on a line by itself."

class Command:

	"""commandInterface.Command									  [public class]
		
			An object of this class represents a specific type of command.
			A command type has an associated symbolic name (identifier).
			It also has a command format, which is a regular expression 
			used to parse the command text.	 Normally this consists of a 
			command escape character like '/' to denote that this text 
			constitutes a command to the GLaDOS system, followed by the 
			command name, followed by whitespace and the command's 
			argument list.	However, divergences from this standard format 
			are possible.

		
		Instance public data members:
		=============================
			
			.name:str - Symbolic name for this command pattern. Usually
				(but not necessarily always) this is also an alphanumeric
				word that invokes the command if following a slash ('/').
				
			.standard:bool=True - If this is True (the default), then the
				command may be invoked by including '/<cmdName>' at the
				start of the input line (or anywhere in the input line,
				if .anywhere=True; see below). If this is False, then a
				custom format string should be supplied.

			.anywhere:bool=False - If this is True, then the command will
				be invoked if its pattern is matched starting anywhere in
				the input line. If this is False, then the command will
				only be invoked if its pattern appears at the start of the
				input line. This setting is only needed for commands with
				auto-generated format strings; custom format strings can
				simply include '^' (or not) at the start of that regex.
	
			.caseSensitive:bool=False - If this is True, then any automatic
				matching of the command name from its name is case-sensitive.

			.prefixInvocable:bool=True - If this is True, then any unique
				prefix of the command name will also automatically invoke
				the command. (But this is ignored if standard=False.)

			.hasSubcmds:bool=False - If this is True, then this command
				has subcommands which we'll try to automatically detect
				and dispatch on.  See also class Subcommand.

			.cmdFormat:str	- Regex-format string for parsing this command
				pattern. This may be supplied manually (for custom parsing)
				or automatically generated.
				
			.unique:bool=True - Boolean that is True if the format regex is
				supposed to uniquely identify this particular command type.
				That is, matching command lines should not match any other
				command types. If this is True and there are multiple matches,
				then we have to disambiguate between those (via an error
				message leading to a further interaction with the user). If
				this is False, then the system invokes the highest-priority
				matching command type that is in a currently-active module.
				NOTE: Setting this to False can be dangerous!!! Beware.
			
			.cmdModule:CommandModule - Command module to which this
				command is associated.


		Subclasses may define the following class-level variables:
		==========================================================

		  Provideable: (not provided by default)
		  ------------

			.name:str - If defined, this is used to initialize cmd.name.

			.cmdFormat:str - If defined, this is used to initialize cmd.cmdFormat.

			.cmdModule:CommandModule - If defined, this is used to
				initialize cmd.module.


		  Overrideable:
		  -------------

			.standard:bool=True - Default value of cmd.standard.

			.takesArgs:bool=True - Default value of cmd.takesArgs.

			.anywhere:bool=False - Default value of cmd.anywhere.

			.caseSens:bool=False - Default value of cmd.caseSens.

			.prefInvoc:bool=True - Default value of cmd.prefInvoc.

			.hasSubcmds:bool=False - Default value of cmd.hasSubcmds.

			.unique:bool=True - Default value of cmd.unique.

			.actionClass:class=CommandAction_ - Subclass of CommandAction_
				that is suitable for the creation of actions for executing
				this command.


		Instance public methods:
		========================
			
			.matches(text:str, anywhere:bool=False) - Returns True if this
				command matches the given text string (usually a single line).
				if anywhere=False, then it must match at the start of the line.
				If anywhere=True and the command's anywhere attribute is True,
				then it can match anywhere in the line.

			.handler(groups:list) - This method is called to actually perform
				the command's functionality in more detail, beyond its basic
				pattern matching. It will be passed the groups (substrings)
				parsed out by the command's regex. For standard commands, this
				just consists of the command name (or prefix) and argument list.
				The default method should be overridden by subclasses.

			.genCmdAction(text:str, by:Entity_) - Generates a command
				action (instance of CommandAction_ or one of its
				subclasses) that is appropriate for invocation of this
				command by the given entity based on the given text
				string.
