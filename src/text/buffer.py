class TextBuffer:		# A text buffer.

	"""
		TextBuffer										   [module public class]
		
			This is a class for text buffers used in the window system.
			Conceptually, a text buffer is a (usually bounded-length)
			linear sequence of individual lines or rows of text.  A given
			line is defined by containing no newline characters, except 
			that (in certain configurations) there is always one at the 
			very end of the line, except that the very last line in the 
			buffer will generally have no newline at the end.
			
			Characteristics of a text buffer include:
			
				- A maximum length in rows, which is an integer >= 0.
					Or, if this is None, then the length is unbounded.
					(WARNING: This is dangerous, as the host may run
					out of space.)
					
				- An iterable, indexible sequence of >= 0 actual lines of 
					text.  If the maximum length is not None, then the
					actual length of this sequence should be no greater 
					than the maximum length.  If this sequence is None, 
					this is deemed equivalent to a sequence of 0 rows.
					
				- A text buffer may optionally also have a maximum width,
					which is the maximum length of any line in the buffer.
					Lines that are longer are either wrapped to the next 
					line or truncated, depending on buffer configuration.
					If there is no maximum width, this can be dangerous.
					
			Operations on a text buffer include:
			
				- The buffer may be cleared (emptied of all content).
				
				- Text (any string) may be appended to the end of the
					buffer.	 This creates new rows as needed.  If the
					maximum number of rows in the buffer would have been
					exceeded, rows are automatically removed from the 
					start of the buffer to make room.

	#|	Private instance data members.					   [class documentation]
	#|
	#|		._maxLen [int or None]
	#|
	#|			This is an integer >= 0 indicating the maximum length of
	#|			the text buffer in rows, or None to indicate that there is
	#|			no maximum length (note that this can be dangerous).
	#|
	#|		._maxWid [int or None]
	#|
	#|			This is an integer >= 0 indicating the maximum length of
	#|			each line of text, in characters, or None if there is no
	#|			maximum length (note that this can be dangerous).  The
	#|			max width does not include any final newline character.
	#|
	#|		._includeNewlines [bool]
	#|
	#|			This is a boolean value which should be True if and only if
	#|			each line (except possibly the last) should be terminated
	#|			with an explicit newline character ('\n').	(If this is False
	#|			then the entire text buffer will contain no newlines.)	(Note
	#|			that the AI's view of the buffer will generally have newlines
	#|			added in any case, so this option doesn't make much difference.)
	#|
	#|		._wrapLines [bool]
	#|
	#|			If this is True, then overlong lines will be wrapped around
	#|			to the next line; otherwise, they will be truncated at 
	#|			._maxWid characters long.
	#|
	#|		._rows [Iterable]
	#|
	#|			This is an iterable, indexible sequence of lines of text,
	#|			each of which should be a string.

						Maximum buffer length in rows of text, or None

					maxWid [int or None]
					
						Maximum buffer width in characters, or None if
