	MODULE NAME:	field.fieldSettings
	IN PACKAGE:		field
	FULL PATH:		$GIT_ROOT/GLaDOS/src/field/fieldSettings.py
	MASTER REPO:	https://github.com/mikepfrank/GLaDOS.git
	SYSTEM NAME:	GLaDOS (General Lifeform and Domicile Operating System)
	APP NAME:		GLaDOS.server (Main GLaDOS server application)
	SW COMPONENT:	GLaDOS.server.settings (Settings management facility)


	MODULE DESCRIPTION:
	===================
	
		This module defines settings that are specific to the receptive 
		field facility.
		
		Unlike most subsystems of GLaDOS, the field settings may be 
		configured in either the top-level system configuration file,
		or the AI-specific config file, which overrides it.  Please note
		that in either case, the configuration parameters only apply when
		the system first starts up, or when it is reconfigured.  See the
		config package for instructions on how to reconfigure the system.
		
		This module works by first gathering all settable data members 
		that are specific to the receptive field facility into a single 
		non-instantiated class called TheFieldSettings.  Then we define
		the singleton class TheFieldSettingsModule which creates and 
		gathers together all of the corresponding Setting objects.
		
		At initialization time, all that the receptive field facility 
		needs to do to activate this module is to create the singleton
		instance of TheFieldSettingsModule (by calling the constructor) 
		and then install it in the settings facility by just adding it 
		at top level within TheSettingsFacility (by passing it to the
		.addToplevelModule() method).
