# receptiveField.py
#
#	Please note that conceptually, this module is considered part of the AI,
#	since some of its basic properties, such as its size, are associated with
#	the AI.  However, we place it in its own package since much the rest of the 
#	system talks to it directly (and to the rest of the AI, less directly).
#
# 	This module implements the input to the AI's main receptive field; 
# 	that it, it displays everything that the A.I. can "see."  This generally
# 	consists of the following:
#
#		1. Any windows that are anchored to the top of the receptive field.
#
#		2. As much as possible of the A.I.'s recent cognitive stream.  This 
#			consists of a sequence of events, labeled with timestamp and author.
#			some events may be window snapshots, or floating windows.  Most 
#			events will simply be blocks of text.
#
#		3. Any windows that are anchored to the bottom of the receptive field.
#
#		4. A separator bar with reminders of important top-level commands.
#
#		5. A prompt or partial event, with the current time and the A.I.'s 
#			name.  Hopefully it responds with a command or text that it wants
#			to add to its cognitive stream.
#
#	The base receptive field can render itself to two different output buffers:
#
#		1. The view of the field (raw field text data) that will be sent to the 
#			AI.  This has the feature that the line length is not limited.
#
#		2. The human-readable field.  This is distinguished by being limited
#			in width for display purposes; overlong lines are wrapped around.
#
#			Further, the human-readable field can be scrolled (by a human
#			terminal user), and it can also be rendered in two-column format,
#			for purposes of displaying more content on wide terminals.
