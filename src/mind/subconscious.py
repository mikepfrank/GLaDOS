	MODULE NAME:	subconscious							   [Python 3 module]
	
	DESCRIPTION:
	============
	
			This module provides support for various "subconscious"
		functionalities of the AI's cognitive system.  To explain
		what this means, let's draw a hierarchy:
				 ____________________________
				/							 \
				|  The AI's Conscious Mind   |-----			_______ 
				\____________________________/     \	   /	   \
							  /\					\____\/	 Core	\
				 _____________||_____________		/    /\   AI	/
				/							 \     /	   \_______/
				|   The AI's Subconscious!   |-----
				\____________________________/
							  /\	
				 _____________||_____________
				/							 \
				|     Automated Functions    |
				\____________________________/
				
			Subconscious functions are distinguished by the fact that
		they, like the AI's conscious mind, invoke the core AI functions
		provided by (say) GPT-3.  However, the conscious mind is not
		aware of the details of what's going on within the subconscious
		(which is why it's called "sub"-conscious).  Yet, the decisions
		made by the subconscious do influence what does transpire in the
		AI's conscious stream of awareness.
		
			The "Automated Functions" below the subconscious are simply
		the algorithmically implemented automated functionality of the
		mind package.  The higher levels aren't aware of these details,
		but again, they influence what happens at the higher levels.
