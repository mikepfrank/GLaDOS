# GLaDOS source code (`GLaDOS/src/`)

**[NOTE: Everything after package #6 is alternate README.md text generated by Dante (GPT-3 v2).]**

"GLaDOS" is an acronym for "**Gladys' Lovely and Dynamic Operating System.**" It is an operating environment for use by text-based AI systems, in the vein of GPT-3.  The present directory contains the Python source code for the GLaDOS system.

*[n.b. -- Please note that there is no particular relation between this facility and the fictional AI named GLaDOS from the Portal video game series.]*


## Top-level files

Here we document the various top-level files that exist immediately under the `src/` directory.

1.	**Source code README file** (`README.md`) - This file.

2.	**Application Definitions File** ([`appdefs.py`](appdefs.py "appdefs.py file")) - 
	Used primarily by the `infrastructure.logmaster` module, this file contains certain key definitions pertaining to the overall application.  These include the names of the overall system, the current application, and its top-level source file.
	
3.	**GLaDOS Server Application Program** ([`glados-server.py`](glados-server.py "glados-server.py file")) -
	This is the main top-level Python application program implementing the core server process of the GLaDOS system.  
	
	**NOTE:** This file is executable, but it should not be executed directly from within this directory, but rather from the parent directory `GLaDOS/`, which contains the `log/` subdirectory, where we will create the system log file.

4.	**Telegram Bot Server Application Program** ([`telegram-bot.py`](telegram-bot.py "telegram-bot.py file")) -
	This is the auxilliary top-level Python application program implementing the AI persona's Telegram bot server. 
	Once this is up and running, the bot service can handle any number of simultaneous individual and group chats.

5.	**Development To-Do List** ([`To-Do.txt`](To-Do.txt "To-Do.txt file")) - 
	Some notes pertaining to what still needs to be done on the GLaDOS implementation. (Note that this file may often be badly out-of-date.)
	

## Package subdirectories

These are the top-level packages that will make up the GLaDOS system.  Note that some of them may eventually also contain subpackages (although they do not yet, as of this writing).


### 1. Applications system ([`apps/`](apps "apps/ directory"))

This package gathers together modules implementing various application programs/tools that are available for use by the A.I. within the GLaDOS environment.  See [the subdirectory's `README.md` file](apps/README.md "apps/README.md file") for a list of the currently planned apps.


### 2. Authorization system ([`auth/`](auth "auth/ directory"))

**[INCOMPLETE]** This package will implement a fine-grained permissions system which is used for gating user access to apps, commands, and settings within GLaDOS, so that, for example, there are certain user commands that can only be invoked by the AI (and not by human users), certain system settings that can only be modified by the AI (*e.g.*, its field display preferences), some things that only the system operator is allowed to do (*e.g.*, shut down the whole system for maintenance), and so forth.


### 3. Command interface ([`commands/`](commands "commands/ directory"))

**[INCOMPLETE]** The commands package provides a top-level command interface and menu system that the AI can use to command and control its instance of the GLaDOS environment.  Top-level commands allow the AI to manipulate its existing windows, launch processes in new windows, modify key settings, skip ahead in time by certain amounts, and so forth.


### 4. Configuration facility ([`config/`](config "config/ directory"))

The configuration package is used to track various configuration parameters of the GLaDOS system.  The AI can modify its own configuration through the Settings interface (which is an app that runs within a window).


### 5. System console ([`console/`](console "console/ directory"))

This is in essence a client "application" (for use by the human system operator, not the AI) which utilizes the `display` package (below) to take over the text terminal screen (using curses) to display a multi-paneled system console, with panels to show the system log, an area for user input, a console panel showing system output and error text streams, and the contents of the AI's receptive field.


### 6. Display management facility ([`display/`](display "display/ directory"))

This package is, in effect, a higher-level convenience wrapper around the lower-level curses library.  It provides support for multithreading, and rendering of control/meta characters using special rendering styles.


### 7. Event handling facility ([events/](events "events/ directory"))

This package defines a simple multi-producer/multi-consumer FIFO queue for handling system events.  The event handling facility is used by various system components to communicate with one another.


### 8. Exception handling facility ([exceptions/](exceptions "exceptions/ directory"))

This package defines a set of custom exception types for use within GLaDOS.


### 9. File management facility ([files/](files "files/ directory"))

This package provides an abstraction layer for file-oriented operations (reading and writing files, manipulating the file system, and so forth).  It is used by various system components, including the logging subsystem and the AI's "personal" files (see below).


### 10. GLaDOS core library ([gladoslib/](gladoslib "gladoslib/ directory"))

This package is the main "core" library for the GLaDOS system.  It defines the main "GLaDOS" class, which is the top-level class for the system as a whole, and a set of related utility functions.


### 11. Logging subsystem ([logging/](logging "logging/ directory"))

The logging subsystem is used by the various components of the GLaDOS system to log various system-level events.  It provides an abstraction layer for writing log entries to the system log file.


### 12. Message passing subsystem ([messages/](messages "messages/ directory"))

This subsystem handles message passing between various system components.  It provides an abstraction layer to allow various system components to communicate with one another.

### 13. Operating system interaction subsystem ([os/](os "os/ directory"))

This package contains an abstraction layer to allow various system components to interact with the underlying host operating system.  It provides functions for, among other things, interacting with the process scheduler, process creation, memory management, and so forth.

### 14. Output management subsystem ([output/](output "output/ directory"))

This package defines various output-related functions and classes, used primarily by the display management facility.


### 15. Package management subsystem ([packages/](packages "packages/ directory"))

This package is used by the system operator to manage the set of installed Python packages that are used by GLaDOS.  It also provides functions for, among other things, creating and removing Python virtual environments.

### 16. Persistent context data subsystem ([persist/](persist "persist/ directory"))

This package is used by the AI to store persistent context data.  The data is stored in a set of files, organized into a hierarchical directory structure.


### 17. Process management subsystem ([processes/](processes "processes/ directory"))

This package contains an abstraction layer to allow various system components to interact with processes.  It provides functions for, among other things, process creation, process termination, and process suspension.


### 18. Reversible computing subsystem ([rc/](rc "rc/ directory"))

[INCOMPLETE] This subsystem is used to support reversible computing within GLaDOS.  It provides an abstraction layer for interacting with reversible computation engines, such as the "Flux Capacitor" package (below).


### 19. Resource management subsystem ([resources/](resources "resources/ directory"))

This subsystem is used to track and manage various system resources, such as memory usage, processor usage, and so forth.  It provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the underlying host operating system's resource management facilities.


### 20. Settings management subsystem ([settings/](settings "settings/ directory"))

This subsystem is used to track and manage various system settings.  It provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the system's configuration files.


### 21. System operator interface subsystem ([sops/](sops "sops/ directory"))

This subsystem is used to support the human system operator's interaction with GLaDOS.  It provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the system operator interface (SOI) application.


### 22. System state management subsystem ([state/](state "state/ directory"))

This subsystem is used to track and manage the current system state.  It provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the system's state files.


### 23. Time management subsystem ([time/](time "time/ directory"))

This subsystem is used to track and manage time within GLaDOS.  It provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the system's timekeeping facilities.


### 24. User interface subsystem ([ui/](ui "ui/ directory"))

This subsystem is used to track and manage the system's user interface.  It provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the system's user interface components.

### 25. World model ([worldmodel/](worldmodel "worldmodel/ directory"))

[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.] This subsystem is responsible for maintaining a "world model" -- a representation of the AI's current understanding of the world.  This model is used by the AI to reason about the world and make predictions.  The model is stored in an internal database format (which may be SQLite, for example).  The subsystem also includes a "reasoner" component that can answer queries about the world model, and a "predictor" component that can generate predictions based on the world model.  The world model may eventually be used to drive a 3D virtual world simulation (see the 'simulation' package, below).

## Future Work

There are a number of additional features / subsystems / services that are planned for inclusion in GLaDOS, but which have not yet been implemented.  These include:

### 1.  A "Subconscious" subsystem

[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.] This subsystem is essentially a second, subordinate mind, running in the background, that is responsible for maintaining a "world model" and for coming up with interesting key words and phrases to search for in memory, browsing the results from this search, and presenting them to the main AI's cognitive sphere in a sort of heads-up display, so that the main AI can be aware of relevant context to the present conversation from its archives.

### 2.  A "Simulation" subsystem

[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.] This subsystem is responsible for maintaining a 3D virtual world simulation, based on the GLaDOS world model.  This simulation may eventually be used to generate training data for the AI, as well as to provide a testbed for experiments with the AI.  The simulation will probably make use of the Bullet physics library.

### 3.  Support for a "Terminal" subsystem

[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.] This subsystem provides a facility for human users to connect to the central GLaDOS server via a text-based terminal interface (using the curses framework).  Eventually, there may be support for multiple terminals, each with its own windowing system (see above).  The terminal may eventually be used to allow the system operator to monitor and control the system, as well as to allow other human users to interact with the AI, *etc.*

### 4.  A "Web" subsystem

[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.] This subsystem provides a facility for GLaDOS to interact with the outside world via a web interface.  This subsystem will probably make use of the Flask web framework.

### 5.  A "GUI" subsystem

[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.] This subsystem provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for GLaDOS, using the Qt framework.  This subsystem will eventually be used to allow the system operator to monitor and control the system, as well as to allow other human users to interact with the AI, *etc.*
