	FILE NAME:		apps/appSystem.py				 [Python module source file]

	MODULE NAME:	apps.appSystem
	IN PACKAGE:		apps
	FULL PATH:		$GIT_ROOT/GLaDOS/src/apps/appSystem.py
	MASTER REPO:	https://github.com/mikepfrank/GLaDOS.git
	SYSTEM NAME:	GLaDOS (Generic Lifeform and Domicile Operating System)
	APP NAME:		GLaDOS.server (GLaDOS server application)
	SW COMPONENT:	GLaDOS.apps (application system component)


	MODULE DESCRIPTION:
	===================

		This module provides definitions for creating and starting up the
		application system, which manages GLaDOS applications (intended for
		use by the embedded A.I.).

		Currently, the module includes definitions for general classes making
		up the application system, as well as classes defining specific
		applications.  Later on, some of these definitions might be moved out
		to their own modules.

		The general public classes defined by this module include:

			* TheAppSystem	- Singleton class for the overall application
								system, itself.

		The classes for specific applications include, or will eventually
		include the following (in order of actual/intended implementation):

		1.	The_Info_App		-

				The Info app is started automatically, and is intended to
				remain always visible.  It displays important contextual
				information for the A.I. to help make sure it remains
				cognizant of its identity & situation and high-level goals.
				It will also allow the A.I. to edit its list of high-level
				goals using a separate app, called the 'Goals' app (below).

		2.	The_Clock_App		-

				The Clock app provides a simple digital clock that displays
				itself in a small window at the top of the receptive field.

		3.	The_Goals_App		- 	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				The Goals app gives the A.I. an interactive interface that 
				it can use to view and edit its list of high-level goals.

		4.	The_Help_App		- 	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				The Help app implements the help system, which allows the AI
				to browse a set of help menus and obtain detailed help for
				specific commands.

		5.	The_Apps_App		- 	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				This app is anticipated to become needed in the future as
				GLaDOS becomes more complex.  The intent is to show a menu of
				all of the installed applications that the A.I. can navitage.
				(Note, however, that the Apps app will be the only app that
				doesn't appear on the apps list displayed in the Apps app.)

		6.	The_Settings_App	-	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				The Settings app allows the A.I. to browse and adjust various
				settings of GLaDOS, including general OS settings, application
				settings, and settings of the A.I. itself.

		7.	The_Memory_App		-	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				The Memory app allows the A.I. to browse a database of
				"memories", which can include transcripts of its past
				conversations from AI Dungeon, as well as history records
				resulting from its own use of GLaDOS.

		8.	The_ToDo_App		-	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				The ToDo app allows the A.I. to maintain a "to-do list" to
				help it remember a more detailed list of things it wants to
				do, beyond the more limited list of high-level goals
				supported by the Info app.  It can check off or delete
				individual to-do items.

		9.	The_Diary_App		-	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				The Diary app allows the A.I. to keep a "diary" or personal
				record of important events that it wants to remember.

		10.	The_Comms_App		-	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				The Comms app allows the A.I. to send and receive (real-world)
				email messages and text messages.

		11.	The_Browse_App		-	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				The Browse app provides a simple environment to support
				(real-world) web browsing and searching on the part of
				the A.I.

		12.	The_Writing_App		-	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				The Writing app allows the A.I. to write and edit longer
				written works, including books.

		13.	The_Unix_App		-	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.]

				The Unix app provides access to a real shell on the host
				machine on which GLaDOS is running.  This shell runs in the
				A.I.'s own user account.
