		appCommands.AppLaunchCommand					 		  [public class]
		
			An app-launch command, such as '/Goals', is a special type of 
			command that launches an app (if not already launched), or 
			foregrounds it (if it was already launched).  To launch an 
			app typically involves the following steps:
		
				(1) Starting up the app (if it was not already started 
					earlier). This starts any background processes 
					associated with the app.
			
				(2) Creating the app's window (or windows, if it has >1 
					window).
			
				(3) Opening the app's window on the receptive field (using 
					its default initial placement).
					
				(4) Installing the app's command module (if it was not 
					already installed).  Possibly also activating the app's
					command module (if we want the app's commands to be
					available whether or not the app is foregrounded).
				
				(4) Foregrounding the app (see below).
			
			To foreground an app typically involves the following steps:
		
				(1) If the app is not already located at its preferred 
					initial placement (e.g., SLIDE_TO_BOTTOM), then we put 
					it there.
					
				(2) Activating the app's command module, if it was not already
					activated--this means its internal commands become available
					for invocation through the GLaDOS command interface.
				
				(3) Give the app the command focus. This means that generic
					app commands and window commands will be directed to that
					specific app (and to its main window). The app that has 
					the command focus is visually indicated with different 
					window decorations (e.g., '===' instead of '~~~' for 
					horizontal borders, command hints in lower border).
