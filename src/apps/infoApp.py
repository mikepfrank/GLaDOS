		The_Info_App			    [public singleton class--GLaDOS application]
		============

			The is a singleton class implementing the 'Info App' or
			"information application" that is available within GLaDOS.

			The idea behind this app is that it maintains and displays
			certain critical contextual information that the A.I. needs
			to know, including its identity, life circumstances, and
			its present high-level goals.  Its window normally remains
			pinned near the top of the A.I.'s receptive field.

			Once the Information app is launched, it allows the A.I. to
			edit certain information such as its high-level goals.

			NOTE: This is one of the few apps that is generally launched
			automatically at system startup.

		# NOTE: The feature to allow the AI to view/edit goals is not

		# contents of a static text file. Also, we've decided that the
		# goal-editing function will be handled by a separate 'Goals' app.
