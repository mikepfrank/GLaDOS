		FILE DESCRIPTION:
		-----------------

				This script constitutes the main server process executable for the
				GLaDOS system.	Within the OS process running this script, threads 
				are created to carry out the following functions (at least):

						1. Primary "mind" thread for the A.I. itself.

						2. Various GLaDOS processes, which may include 'bridge' 
								processes for communicating to external systems (e.g.,
								Internet-based services), or to local resources (e.g., 
								Unix command prompt), or to internal subsystems of
								the GLaDOS system itself, such as the memory system,
								the settings interface, & the book authoring system.

						3. A thread for managing the text-based 'windowing' system
								inside of GLaDOS, which is the primary 'GUI' seen by 
								the A.I.  (The windowing system itself is not a GLaDOS
								process per se; it is used by the A.I. to interact 
								*with* GLaDOS processes.)

	#|	0. Debugging flags								[module code section]
	#|	==================
	#|
	#|		These flags are defined at the top of the module so that we
	#|		can find and modify them quickly and easily during development.
	#|		All other globals are defined later, in section 2.
	#|
	#|
	#|	RAW_DEBUG:bool								[module global parameter]
	#|	--------------
	#|
	#|			Raw debugging flag for the current module.	This is 
	#|			a very low-level feature, preliminary to any more 
	#|			sophisticated diagnostic-logging capability.  The 
	#|			module code can check this flag before doing any 
	#|			low-level diagnostic output.  This then allows all 
	#|			such diagnostic output in this module to be easily 
	#|			suppressed changing this flag to False.
	#|
	#|
	#|	CONS_DEBUG:bool								[module global parameter]
	#|	---------------
	#|
	#|			If this is True, then all debug-level output sent 
	#|			to the infrastructure.logmaster module will also be
	#|			displayed on the console.  This applies throughout 
	#|			the server application (not just in this module).
	#|
	#|
	#|	LOG_DEBUG:bool							   [module global parameter]
	#|	--------------
	#|
	#|			If this is True, then debug-level output sent to
	#|			the infrastructure.logmaster module will be recorded
	#|			in the system log file, '../log/GLaDOS.server.log'.
	#|			Note this applies throughout the server application,
	#|			not just in the current module.
