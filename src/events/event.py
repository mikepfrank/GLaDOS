	MODULE NAME:	events.event
	
	DESCRIPTION:
	
		This is the core module of the "events" package; it provides the
		definition of a class TextEvent, which keeps track of informaton 
		such as the date/time and source of an event consisting of a piece
		of text.  There are also classes for working with event formats, 
		which determine how TextEvent objects are translated to actual 
		displayed text.  The AI can select how events that it is viewing 
		in its receptive field will be formatted.
