#|          Miscellaneous utilities.  These include the
#|          following network-related utility functions:
#|
#|              get_hostname()  - Get first (pre-".") component of current
#|                               machine's hostname.
#|
#|              get_my_ip() - Get the IP address (in standard format) of
#|                               the current machine.
#|
#|          as well as the following class/object related functions/classes:
#|
#|              bind() - Bind a class method to a specific instance.
#|
#|              become() - Reassign the given object to a new class.
#|
#|              MutableClass - Base class for objects that can change class.
#|
#|          and the string functions:
#|
#|              unsplit() - Concatenate a list of strings with a given
#|                              delimiter in between.
#|
#|          and another useful class:
#|
#|              WatchBox - A watchable storage location.
#|
#|          This module also contains the following miscellaneous functions:
#|
#|              count() - Count the number of items in an iterable.
#|
#|              seqno() - Generate a unique sequence number.

    #|          ._contents:object -
    #|
    #|                  The object contained in the box.  A
    #|                  WatchBox can only contain one object
    #|                  at a time.
    #|
    #|          ._updated:flag.Flag -
    #|
    #|                  A flag that is raised (if not already
    #|                  raised) or waved (if already raised)
    #|                  whenever the box's contents are updated.
    #|          
    #|
    #|      Special methods:
    #|
    #|          .__init__(initialContents, lock)
    #|
    #|              New instance initializer.  The box's initial
    #|              contents and the RLock to use may be optionally
    #|              specified.  If not specified, the initial contents
    #|              are None and a new RLock is created.
    #|
    #|          .__call__()
    #|
    #|              Call method.  When the box is called, it simply
    #|              returns its current contents.
    #|
    #|      Public properties:
    #|
    #|          .contents -
    #|
    #|              The present contents of the WatchBox.  That is,
    #|              if box is a WatchBox, then box.contents evaluates
    #|              to the box's present contents, which you can
    #|              modify using "box.contents = <newValue>".
    #|              Waiters are alerted on modification.
    #|
    #|      Public methods:
    #|
    #|          .hold(newContents) -
    #|
    #|              Modifies the box's contents, causing it to hold
    #|              the given <newContents>.  Returns the previous
    #|              contents.
    #|
    #|          .wait(timeout) -
    #|
    #|              Waits for an optional timeout (which defaults to
    #|              None, meaning wait indefinitely) for the box's
    #|              contents to be updated.  When updated, returns
    #|              the new contents.
    #|
    #|      Example usage:
    #|
    #|          In thread 1:
    #|
    #|              box = WatchBox(1)       # create box w. initial contents
    #|              print(box())            # prints 1
    #|              box.contents = 2        # use property setter
    #|
    #|          In thread 2:
    #|
    #|              newVal = box.wait()     # wait for contents to be updated
    #|              print(newVal)           # prints 2
