	FILE NAME:		infrastructure/logmaster.py	   [Python 3 module source file]
  
	MODULE NAME:	logmaster
	FULL PATH:		$GIT_ROOT/GLaDOS/src/logmaster.py
	MASTER REPO:	https://github.com/mikepfrank/GLaDOS.git
	SYSTEM NAME:	GLaDOS (Generic Lifeform and Domicile Operating System)
	APP NAME:		GLaDOS.server (GLaDOS server application)
	SW COMPONENT:	GLaDOS.logging
  
  
	SOFTWARE SYSTEM:		GLaDOS (Generic Lifeform and Domicile Operating System)
	----------------
  
		Note:  Although the present file exists as part of the
		GLaDOS system, the logmaster module is actually designed
		to be usable in any software system; it does not depend
		on any other parts of the GLaDOS system.
  
  
	SOFTWARE COMPONENT:		GLaDOS.logging
	-------------------
  
		For our purposes, a "software component" means a set of
		modules that are logically related to each other and
		that together implement some important capability.
		Component names generally appear in log record output,
		with the exception of the present component.
 
  
	MODULE DESCRIPTION:
	-------------------
  
		This module provides a customized logger based on Python's
		general logging facility.  The intent of putting this code
		into its own module is to enable its definitions to be
		accessed from within any number of other modules in the
		application, so they all can do logging in a consistent way
		This is particularly important when debugging.
  
		The specific new logging functionality we provide includes:
  
			 1.	 A new logging level called "NORMAL" is added
				 (in between INFO and WARNING).	 Its purpose
				 is to enable messages that are ordinarily
				 printed on stdout to be simultaneously logged
				 to the log file as NORMAL-level messages.
  
			 2.	 Ultra-convenient logging functions are exported
				 (debug(), info(), etc.) that do not require
				 even specifying a logger.
  
			 3.	 The logger can be configured (via global bools)
				 to display or not display various "optional"
				 levels of log messages (warning, info, debug)
				 to the console (stderr), and, separately, to
				 save them or not save them in the log file.
  
			 4.	 The logging formats for the file loghandlers
				 include the time, down to the millisecond.
  
			 5.	 All formats include the log level (except for
				 NORMAL messages displayed on stdout).
  
			 6.	 All log messages (again except normal messages
				 to the console) always include the
				 thread name, to facilitate debugging of
				 multithreaded programs.


	MODULE USAGE:
	-------------

		These are basic usage instructions, but for more features,
		see the rest of the module docs.  To use the logmaster
		module in an application,

			(1) In a file appdefs.py, define and export the
					globals systemName, appName, and topFile.
					systemName should be a string (a concise
					name for the software system); appName
					should be another string, in the format
					"<systemName>.<appSuffix>" (w/o brackets),
					and topFile should be the name of the
					top-level application script (w/o .py).

			(2) In the main application script and each
					module, import the logmaster module.

						import logmaster

			(3) In the main application script, do something
					like the following:

						logmaster.configLogMaster(role='startup',
							component=logmaster.appName)
						logger = logmaster.appLogger

					and thence, for normal program output, do:

						logger.normal("Blah blah blah...")

					and for logging at other levels, use logger.info(),
					logger.warn(), etc.	 After the startup phase of the
					program is over, you can change the thread role
					designation with something like

						logmaster.setThreadRole('running')	  ;

					this role designator appears in log file output.

			(4) At the top of other modules (after importing logmaster),
					do something like:

						logger = logmaster.getComponentLogger('<compName>')

					where <compName> is the formal name of the software
					component that that module is conceptually a part of.
					The component name will appear in log file output.

			(5) Look for output in the file <appName>.log.

		There are additional features for multithreaded applications
		and for generating automatically-logged exceptions.
		

	PUBLIC GLOBALS:
	---------------

	  The following are the global attributes of this module, which
	  may be accessed by other modules.


		Public constants:
		-----------------

			logmaster.{NORMAL_LEVEL,NORMAL}:int [public global constant integer]

				These constants identify a new logging level for
				normal program output.	(Above INFO, below WARNING.)
				NORMAL is just provided as a shorter name for
				NORMAL_LEVEL.


			logmaster.{systemName,sysName}:str	[public global constant string]

				Name of the overall system we are a part of.  This can
				be modified if needed for another application by
				assigning to logmaster.systemName any time before
				logmaster.configLogMaster() is called, or as an
				optional argument to it.  This name is important for
				setting up the logger (logging channel) hierarchy.


			logmaster.appName:str				[public global constant string]

				Name of the current application within the overall
				system.	 This can be modified if needed for another
				application by assigning to logmaster.appName any time
				before logmaster.configLogMaster() is called, or as an
				optional argument to it.  This name is important for
				setting up the logger (logging channel) hierarchy.


			logmaster.{NAME,THREADNAME,COMPONENT,	[public global constant integers]
				THREADROLE,MODULE,FUNCNAME,
				LEVELNAME}_FIELDWIDTH : int

				These integer parameters determine the widths of the
				corresponding fields of our default log line format
				string.	 Their values are also used by the
				CleanFormatter class to abbreviate content to the
				desired width before it is formatted, so that it
				doesn't overflow its field.


			logmaster.LOG_FORMATSTR:str			[public global constant string]
				
				Default line format for the main log file.	Actually,
				this "constant" can be modified if needed before
				initLogMaster() is called, or as an optional argument
				to initLogMaster().


			logmaster.{CONS_{WARN,INFO,DEBUG},	[public global constant booleans]
				LOG_{INFO,DEBUG}:bool
				
				Change these Booleans to modify how the logging levels
				for the console and the main log file are set up.
				Normally (using the default values recommended below)
				the console will show warnings and higher, and the log
				file will show info-level messages and higher.	For
				more flexible control, you can always just set the log
				level explicitly.


			logmaster.{log,console}_level:int
												[public global constant integers]
				
				These keep track of what logging level we are using for
				both the main log file and the console.	 Change these
				indirectly using configLogMaster().


			logmaster.minLevel:int				[public global constant integer]

				This is the minimum logging level we will display
				considering both the log file and console levels.


			logmaster.{doDebug,doInfo,doNorm,doWarn,doErr}:bool
												[public global constant booleans]

				Each of these booleans is set to True if the present
				minimum logging level is less than or equal to the
				specified level.


			logmaster.consHandler:logging.StreamHandler	  [public global object]
			
				A logging.StreamHandler that sends log lines to the
				system console (i.e., standard output).


		Public objects:
		---------------
				
			logmaster.logFormatter:LogFormatter			[public global object]
				
				This is the default LogFormatter instance used by
				logmaster for the main application log file.  It is
				based on the format string LOG_FORMATSTR above.	 It
				is created in initLogMaster().


			logmaster.theLoggingContext:LoggingContext
											[public global thread-local object]
				
				This is a single (but thread-local) LoggingContext
				object, to be shared by all modules (but it is
				different for each thread), for passing to their
				module-specific loggerAdapter objects that they
				will use for logging.  This object is created in
				this module, (in init_logging()), it gets
				initialized separately within each thread, and
				then it is updated dynamically, if needed, as
				the thread progresses.	It maintains thread-
				specific information, such as the thread's role
				and the software component that it is part of.


			logmaster.mainLogger:Logger					[public global object]
				
				This is the main logger for the application.  It can
				be used in modules that don't bother to define their
				own logger (but most modules should define a logger,
				either based on the systemName, the appName, or at
				least the module's own name).
				
				We don't initialize this when the module is first
				loaded, but wait until initLogMaster() is called,
				which should be done only once in the program, before
				using any of the logging capabilities.
				
				
			logmaster.{sysLogger,appLogger}:Logger		[public global objects]
				
				These are additional loggers that are included in the
				default logger hierarchy; they are both subordinate
				to the main logger, while being specific to the
				present system, and to the present application within
				the system, respectively.  


	EXCEPTION CLASSES:
	------------------

		Applications may subclass or mixin these classes to create
		their own exception classes that automatically generate log
		entries at designated logging levels.  See these classes'
		docstrings for additional details.	The indentation below
		indicates the subclass relationships between these classes.

			logmaster.LoggedException			[module public exception class]

			  logmaster.InfoException			[module public exception class]

				logmaster.ExitException			[module public exception class]

			  logmaster.WarningException		[module public exception class]

				logmaster.WrongThreadWarning	[module public exception class]

			  logmaster.ErrorException			[module public exception class]

				logmaster.CriticalException		[module public exception class]

				  logmaster.FatalException		[module public exception class]


	PUBLIC CLASSES:
	---------------

		Public classes exported by this module, other than exception
		classes.  See the classes' docstrings for additional details.

			logmaster.CleanFormatter					 [module public class]
			
			logmaster.LoggingContext					 [module public class]

			logmaster.ThreadActor						 [module public class]

			logmaster.AbnormalFilter					 [module public class]

			logmaster.NormalLogger						 [module public class]

			logmaster.NormalLoggerAdapter				 [module public class]

global	systemName, sysName, appName, topFile
	# - The initial values of these that are defined later in this file are
	#	placeholders that should never be used.

	# NOTE: There's a big problem with the below import of the appdefs module,
	# which is that it implies you can't have more than one application in
	# a single source tree.  This is a problem because we're using the
	# logmaster module from multiple applications, and we don't want to
	# replicate the entire source tree for each application.  So, we're
	# going to have to do something about this eventually.

	# UPDATE: This has now been fixed -- to get this to work correctly,
	# the top-level program for the application must import the appdefs
	# module, and then call selectApp() to set the values of the global
	# variables appName, systemName, and sysName.  This must be done before
	# the logmaster module is imported.  That way, when we import the

				#|--------------------------------------------------------------
				#|
				#|	NORMAL_LEVEL,NORMAL:int			   [public global constants]
				#|
				#|		These constants identify a new logging level for
				#|		normal program output.	(Above INFO, below WARNING.)
				#|
				#|		NOTE: It might be imagined that NORMAL should be
				#|		between WARNING and ERROR instead, so that the
				#|		console log level can be set to NORMAL to cause
				#|		warnings to be suppressed from the console without
				#|		suppressing normal output.	However, this is
				#|		ensured anyway since the NormalLogger.normal()
				#|		method prints the given message to stdout
				#|		unconditionally, in addition to maybe logging it
				#|		using appropriate handlers.	 So, if we want to
				#|		suppress warnings from the console, we can just
				#|		set the console log level to ERROR, and we will
				#|		still see normal output (but not warnings).
				#|
				#|		Having NORMAL be between INFO and WARNING instead
				#|		is useful because it means that if the file log
				#|		level is set to WARNING, warnings (which may be
				#|		useful for detecting possible problems) will be
				#|		logged, while normal output (which may be
				#|		excessive) will not be.	 If we wish to log normal
				#|		output as well as warnings, we can set the file
				#|		log level to NORMAL.  And if we also want verbose
				#|		output, we can set the file log level to INFO.
				#|		And for maximum diagnostics for debugging, we set
				#|		the file log level to DEBUG.

	#|
	#|		In this section, we have initialization code for the
	#|		logmaster module, which is supposed to be executed
	#|		whenever this module is first loaded.  Normally, a given
	#|		module will only be loaded once anyway per python
	#|		interprer session.	But, we check and set our
	#|		"_initialized" flag anyway,to make extra sure we don't
	#|		accidentally re-initialize the module.	(To intentionally
	#|		reinitialize it, users can explicitly call
	#|		logmaster.initLogMaster() for themselves.)

if not _initialized:	 # If the module is not already initialized,
	#if hasattr(sys, "stderr") and sys.stderr != None:	 # Needed b/c in some environments, it's not defined!
	#	 print("logmaster.py: Initializing logmaster module...", file=sys.stderr)
	initLogMaster()			# then initialize it.
