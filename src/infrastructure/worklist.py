	APP NAME:		GLaDOS.server (Main GLaDOS server application)
	SW COMPONENT:	GLaDOS.server.work (Multithreaded work management facility)


	MODULE DESCRIPTION:
	===================
	
		Originally developed as part of the COSMICi project, this module 
		provides a "work-management facility" for use in multithreaded 
		environments.
		
		Rationale: Often, in a multithreaded environment, there is a piece
		of work (a task) that needs to be done within a certain predesignated 
		thread to avoid concurrency issues (such as manipulating the state of 
		a complex UI), but meanwhile there are other, asynchronously running 
		threads that are providing the work items, and ordering (triggering) 
		the work items (tasks) to be carried out.
		
		Or, a similar scenario, a certain thread (e.g. a UI event handler) 
		generates a sequence of tasks that need to get done (in a certain 
		order), but the thread does not want to itself wait for the tasks to 
		be completed before going on to other urgent tasks (like redrawing UI 
		elements).	So it would like to pass the tasks to some other, 
		background thread whose job it is to accomplish them.
		
		The idea of the Worklist abstraction is that it makes it "easy" to pass 
		bits of work from one thread to another, and get work done in the 
		background.
		
		In the context of the GLaDOS server, the primary use of worklists is
		to keep track of a queue of curses-associated tasks to be carried out,
		where these tasks typically involving updating the curses display.	A
		single thread called the "display driver" then executes these tasks.
		This effectively serializes execution of these tasks, and ensures that 
		the curses library itself always remains in a self-consistent state.
		Other threads can submit tasks to the display driver's worklist for 
		processing, including background processing, so that the other threads
		don't have to wait for the display to finish updating to continue their
		own work.

#	Classes provided:
#
#		Flag - A Boolean condition that can be waited on.
#			A customer can check (non-blocking) whether the
#			flag is raised, or he can wait (blocking, with
#			optional timeout) for it to be raised.	All
#			waiters are notified when the flag is raised.
#			(Note: This one has since been moved out to its
#			own module, called "flag".)
#
#		WorkItem - A specific task that needs to be done.
#			It carries various flags for requesting and
#			reporting various actions.
#
#		Worklist - A FIFO queue of work items that need
#			doing. A worklist can have one or more workers
#			assigned to follow it.	The presumption is
#			that any worker assigned to the worklist
#			could do any item that might appear on it.
#			(Although if a worker gets a task it can't
#			do, it could put it back on the bottom of
#			the list - though this could lead to task
#			starvation, so is not recommended.)
#
#		Delegator - A special kind of thread whose job
#			it solely to delegate work items on a given
#			worklist to individual workers -
#			preferentially, ones who are not already
#			busy (if any).
#
#			The general process for a delegator is as
#			follows:  Wait for a work item to appear on
#			the work list.	Once we have gotten a work
#			item, check all workers assigned to this
#			worklist to see if any are free.  If one is,
#			drop the work item on his desk.	 If none are
#			free, then find the worker who has the
#			smallest total number of items waiting on all
#			his incoming assignments plus his inbox, and
#			drop the item onto the assignment between our
#			worklist and that worker.
#			
#		Assignment - A medium-sized queue of work items
#			from a given worklist that have been delegated
#			to a given worker.	Assignments allow tasks
#			from a given worklist that have been assigned
#			to one worker to be taken over by another worker
#			assigned to that worklist who is wandering
#			around looking for some work to do.
#
#		Inbox - A small queue of work items that are
#			"owned" by a specific worker, i.e., that cannot
#			be reassigned to other workers.	 
#
#		Desk - A very small queue of work items that are
#			about to be done by a specific worker.	
#
#		Worker - A thread whose sole job is to wait for work
#			items to appear on its desk, in its inbox, or on
#			any of the worklists it is following.
#
#				free - A flag: Is the worker available
#						(i.e., not currently busy)?
#
#			The general process for each worker is as follows:
#			If there is a work item on my desk then do it;
#			otherwise, check my inbox, and if there is a work
#			item there, then move it to my desk; next, check
#			all my incoming assignments for work; next, check
#			all the outgoing assignments of all my worklists
#			for work.  If no work is found, then just stare at
#			my desk and wait for someone to drop a piece of
#			work on it.

class WorklistModuleException(LoggedException):
	defLogger = _logger

		#-----------------------------------------------------------------
		#	WorkItemException [module public class] - The superclass of
		#		special exceptions raised by objects of class WorkItem.

class WorkItemException(WorklistModuleException): pass

		#-----------------------------------------------------------------
		#	NotOwner [module public class] - Exception indicating that a 
		#		thread that did not own this work item tried to execute
		#		certain methods only allowed to be executed by its owner.

class NotOwner(WorkItemException, ErrorException): pass

		#-----------------------------------------------------------------
		#	AlreadyStarted [module public class] - An exception declaring
		#		that a WorkItem (task) could not be started, or could not
		#		be assigned to a new owner, because work on it has already
		#		been started previously.

class AlreadyStarted(WorkItemException, ErrorException): pass

		#-----------------------------------------------------------------
		#	WorkAborted [module class] - An exception declaring that we
		#		quit work early on a given WorkItem b/c the abortRequested
		#		flag was raised.

class WorkAborted(WorkItemException, InfoException): pass

	#-----------------------------------------------------------------
	#	EarlyCompletion [module class] - A special class of exceptions
	#		That simply denotes that a task has used the statement
	#		"raise EarlyCompletion" to break out of itself early,
	#		somewhere deep down inside the call stack.	This invokes
	#		'finally' clauses as needed on the way out to do clean-up.
	#		EarlyCompletion does indicate completion of the task, so
	#		a worker should mark that the work item as complete when
	#		catching this exception.  This is taken care of
	#		automatically by WorkItem's do() method.  To denote that
	#		the work item is NOT complete, the task should raise
	#		some other class of exception.

class EarlyCompletion(WorkItemException, InfoException): pass

	#-------------------------------------------------------------------
	#	NullCallable [module class] - Callable in the worklist is None.

class NullCallable(WorkItemException, ErrorException): pass


	#-----------------------------------------------------
	# Special exceptions that worklists might raise.

class WorklistException(WorklistModuleException): pass

		# Worklist is closed (temporarily or permanently).

class WorklistClosed(WorklistException, WarningException): pass

		# Worklist is closed forever.

class WorklistClosedForever(WorklistClosed, WarningException): pass

		# Argument to addItem() is not a work item.

class NotAWorkItem(WorklistException, ErrorException, TypeError): pass

	#--------------------------------------------------------
	# Special exceptions that worker objects might raise.

class WorkerException(WorklistModuleException): pass

		# Raising this exception denotes that the worker thread
		# is exiting because its exitRequested flag was raised.

class ExitingByRequest(WorkerException, InfoException): pass

		# A request of a worker could not be satisfied because
		# that worker is currently in the process of exiting,
		# and/or its worklist has been closed to new items.

class WorkerExiting(WorkerException, WarningException): pass

	#-----------------------------------------------------------------
	# Worklist [module public class] - This early base class
	#		declaration is so that WorkItem can refer to a generic
	#		Worklist type in argument type declarations, even though
	#		the actual worklist classes are defined later.	It is
	#		overridden later by a more detailed class definition.

class Worklist(Desque): pass


	#--------------------------------------------------------------------
	# WorkItem [module class] - An item that may be put on a worklist;
	#		a task that needs to be done at some point in the future.
	#		Normally, a WorkItem may only be on one worklist at a time.
	#
	#		Work items include flags to keep track of whether they
	#		have been done yet or not, so that when they are
	#		completed, their customers can be notified.	 They also
	#		keep track of whether work on them has started, whether
	#		they failed, their results, etc.
	#
	#		A work item also has a flag called pauseRequested; the
	#		intent of this is that the thread working on the task
	#		should check this flag periodically (when convenient),
	#		and if it is up, it should then raise the paused flag,
	#		and wait for the pauseRequested flag to be lowered.
	#		This allows the worker thread to be externally
	#		paused.	 However, there is no guarantee that the
	#		worker will check for pause requests frequently (or
	#		at all).
	#
	#		Similarly, a flag called abortRequested requests the
	#		worker thread to please abort work on this item.
	#
	#		Currently, there is no easy way that a work item can be
	#		suspended in the middle, put back on some work queue,
	#		and completed later by some other thread.  This could
	#		possibly be implemented using generators, but that
	#		would require the task's code to be written in a special
	#		way using periodic yield statements, and an enclosing
	#		loop to run through the iterator until suspended.
	#
	#		However, work on a task could be suspended and then
	#		resumed later within the SAME worker thread by simply
	#		suspending the thread itself.

class WorkItem:
	
	#------------------------------------------------------------
	# Instance variables:
	#
	#		lock:RLock - A reentrant mutex lock that is designed
	#				to prevent more than one thread from working
	#				on a given work item at the same time.
	#
	#		maker:Thread - The thread (usually a worker thread)
	#				that created this work item.
	#
	#		task:callable - A callable object representing the
	#				work that needs to be done.	 We call it to
	#				do the actual work.	 It should take one
	#				argument, which will be the whole workItem
	#				structure of which it is a part.
	#
	#		worklist:Worklist - The work list that this
	#				particular work item is on, if any (or None).
	#
	#		owner:Thread - The worker thread that currently
	#				owns this WorkItem.	 Usually this will be
	#				a member of the Worker subclass of Thread.
	#
	#		result:object - The result, if any, that was
	#				returned by the callable which was invoked
	#				to execute this work item.
	#
	#		exception:BaseException - The exception, if any,
	#				that was raised by the callable which was
	#				invoked to execute this work item
	#
	#	The following are flags for various conditions; 
	#	customers can wait for any these flags to be raised
	#	using their wait() methods.	 The only ones that may
	#	be lowered are the ...Requested flags, and "paused".
	#	(I guess "owned" could also be lowered, if an
	#	unstarted item got moved back out to a project
	#	worklist.)	onWorklist could also go down.
	#
	#		owned:Flag - Declares that this task is owned
	#				(assigned to) a specific worker.
	#
	#		onWorklist:Flag - Declares that this task is on
	#				some worklist or other.
	#
	#		inProgress:Flag - Declares that some thread has started
	#				to work on this particular task.
	#
	#		pauseRequested:Flag - Declares that somebody wants
	#				work on this task to be suspended ASAP.
	#
	#		paused:Flag - Declares that work on this task has
	#				been suspended, and will remain suspended
	#				until the pauseRequested flag is lowered.
	#
	#		abortRequested:Flag - Declares that somebody wants
	#				work on this task to be terminated ASAP,
	#				regardless of successful completion of the
	#				task.  (May not be honored by task code.)
	#
	#		exitRequested:Flag - Declares that somebody wants
	#				the task to terminate as soon as it can
	#				do so normally. (And consider itself done.)
	#
	#		haveResult:Flag - Declares that this task has
	#				yielded a result (or an exception).
	#
	#		stopped:Flag - Declares that work on this task has
	#				stopped (either because it completed normally,
	#				or due to an abort or other exceptional
	#				condition).
	#
	#		done:Flag - Declares that this work item is finished.
	#				Customers can wait for the work to be done
	#				using workItem.wait().
	#
	#		failed:Flag - Declares that an attempt to complete
	#				this work item failed due to an exception
	#				other than EarlyCompletion.

	#	Worker [module public class] - Generic base class for worker threads.
	#
	#		This early declaration is so that the Worklist class can
	#		refer to a generic Worker type, even though our worker
	#		subclasses are not defined till later.	This is overridden
	#		later by a more specific definition.

class Worker(ThreadActor): pass

	#---------------------------------------------------------------------
	#	Worklist [module private class] - Generic base class for
	#		worklists of various specific types.
	#
	#		(ProjectWorklist, AssignmentWorklist, InboxWorklist,
	#		DesktopWorklist) abbreviated (Worklist, Assignment, Inbox,
	#		Desk).
	#
	#		DesktopWorklist - A very small Desque, normally limited to just
	#			1 or a few items, representing work item(s) that a given
	#			worker is about to start work on (after finishing the
	#			current work item).
	#	
	#			The desktop is a Desque rather than a simple variable so
	#			that if a customer needs a task done urgently, he can put
	#			the item on top of the desk and it will be done as soon
	#			as the worker finishes his current task.  For faster
	#			response, the customer could also request the worker to
	#			exit, abort, or suspend his current task - if it can be
	#			supended it can be put back on the desk.  Items on a
	#			worker's desktop are owned by the worker.
	#

		#
		#		addItem(item) - Adds the given work item to the worklist,
		#				at the end of the queue.  Use for lower-priority
		#				work items.	 Blocks till there is room on the list.
		#
		#		addItem_nowait(item) - Like addItem, but throws a Full
		#				exception instead of blocking if there's no room.
		#
		#		addItem_head(task) - Also adds the given work item to the worklist,
		#				but at the head of the queue.  Use for high-priority
		#				work items.
		#
		#		addItem_head_nowait(task) - Like addItem_head(), but throws
		#				a Full exception instead of blocking if there's no room.
		#
		#		empty() - Inherited from Queue.	 Returns True if the worklist
		#				is empty.  Otherwise, returns False.  Not guaranteed
		#				to remain stable except within the context of a
		#				"with worklist.lock:" statement.
		#
		#		full() - Inherited from Queue.	Returns True if and only if the
		#				worklist is full.  Not guaranteed to remain stable except
		#				within the context of a "with worklist.lock:" statement.
		#
		#		getItem() - Removes and returns the work
		#				item at the head of the worklist.  If no work items
		#				are there now, waits for one to appear.
		#
		#		getItem_nowait() - Removes the work item
		#				at the head of the worklist, if any; otherwise,
		#				raises the Empty exception.
		#
		#		close()/reopen()/closeForever() - For closing/unclosing/
		#				permanently closing the worklist from having new
		#				work items added to it.

		# The reason for adding these addItem()/getItem() methods, rather than
		# just having the user use the underlying Desque put()/get() methods
		# directly, is so that we can ensure that any changes are done in a
		# context where our mutex lock is being held.  Since the lock is
		# re-entrant, user code can take advantage of this.
		#
		# For example, a user who wants to add an item to a worklist if and
		# only if it is empty can simply write something like:
		#
		#		with worklist.lock:
		#			if worklist.empty():
		#				worklist.addItem(item)
		#
		# This works because no other thread that goes through our interface
		# can modify the worklist between the empty() test and the addItem().
		#
		# Another example: To get an item without blocking, and without having
		# to worry about handling a possible Empty exception, write:
		#
		#		with worklist.lock:
		#			if worklist.empty():
		#				item = None
		#			else
		#				item = worklist.getItem()
		#		if (item)
		#			...		# Process the item.
		#
		# That particular code works as long as None is never itself added
		# to the worklist - which we also enforce in the various addItem()
		# methods.
		#
		# Code like the above may be easier to read than the other approach,
		# using a try/except clause around getItem_nowait() that checks for
		# the Empty exception.

	#------------------------------------------------------------------
	# Worker [module class] - A thread that just follows a worklist.
	#
	#	A worker is a thread whole sole purpose in life is to wait for,
	#	claim ownership of, and carry out tasks that appear on a given
	#	worklist.  There may be multiple workers taking tasks from a
	#	given worklist, but in that case the order of completion of the
	#	tasks is undefined.	 If there is only one worker for a given
	#	worklist, then the tasks on that worklist are done in order.
	#
	#	Types of workers:
	#
	#		DeskWorker - Just does work items placed on his desk,
	#			which is a Desque (double-ended synchronized queue).
	#			Items may be placed on the Desque in either LIFO
	#			mode (at the front of the queue) or FIFO mode (at
	#			the back of the queue.	The point of this flexibility
	#			is so that high-priority work items can be inserted
	#			right at the front of the desk-worker's queue.	The
	#			capacity of the desk worklist is usually quite
	#			limited (1-10 items).  Too many items on the desk
	#			may make the worker feel overwhelmed!
	#
	#		OfficeWorker - An OfficeWorker has, in addition to his
	#			Desk, an Inbox, which is another Worklist that is
	#			normally FIFO.	An OfficeWorker first does the work
	#			on his desk; if there is nothing on his desk, he
	#			checks his Inbox, if there is nothing there either
	#			he goes back and waits on his desk.	 Someone giving
	#			work to an OfficeWorker should put it on his desk
	#			if it's empty, and on his Inbox otherwise.
	#
	#		ProjectWorker - An OfficeWorker who also works on one
	#			or more project teams.	When he runs out of work
	#			to do in his desk and inbox, he examines his
	#			assignments, and then his teammates' assignments,
	#			for work to take over.	He can also take work
	#			directly from the project worklist.	 However, if
	#			there's nothing to do, he goes back to staring at
	#			his desk, waiting for work to arrive.
	#
	#		ProjectManager - A.k.a. a Delegator.  He is like an
	#			office worker whose inbox represents all the tasks
	#			that need to be done on a certain project.	He takes
	#			tasks from the project worklist and delegates them
	#			to team members who appear to be the least busy.
	#
	#	NOTE:  None of the above special types of workers have been
	#	implemented yet.  So far, just the basic Worker class has been
	#	perfectly adequate for our purposes.

	#			try to modify the worker data structure at the same time
	#			in an inconsistent way.
	#

	#
