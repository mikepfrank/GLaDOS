	#/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	#|	This module implements the main GLaDOS system console display client,
	#|	which provides the main user interface for the server application.
	#|
	#|	Here is a rough sketch of the console display layout (please note that
	#|	this is not actual size, or to scale):
	#|
	#|		/---------------------------------------- GLaDOS System Console ----------------------------------------\
	#|		| [This area is used to display a human-readable	| [The receptive field display flows around to		|
	#|		|  rendition of the AI's entire receptive field.	|  this column, if it doesn't fit in the first		|
	#|		|  Any normally-nonprintable ASCII characters are	|  column.]											|
	#|		|  rendered using special display codes & styles.	|													|
	#|		|  The view of the receptive field is also word-	|													|
	#|		|  wrapped to fit within the column.  The screen	|													|
	#|		|  is divided into two roughly equal-size columns,	|													|
	#|		|  unless the screen width is less than 120 char-	|													|
	#|		|  acter cells, in which case we use only a single	|													|
	#|		|  column.  If the receptive field doesn't fit in	|													|
	#|		|  the allotted area, a scrollable curses "pad"		|													|
	#|		|  larger than the visible area is utilized to		|													|
	#|		|  allow the user to browse the entire field.]		+--- Diagnostic Output -----------------------------+
	#|		|													| [This area is used to display what would norm-  	|
	#|		|  													|  ally be the STDOUT/STDERR streams from the 	  	|
	#|		|   												|  server process.  STDERR output is rendered	  	|
	#|		|   												|  in red.  STDOUT text comes out in green.		  	|
	#|		|  													|  Operator can scroll back in this window.			|
	#|		|  													+--- Operator Input --------------------------------+
	#|		|													| [This area is a text box that the human operator  |
	#|		|													|  can use to input commands/text to the system.]	|
	#|		+--- System Log ------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
	#|		| [This area is for real-time display of detailed log lines being spooled to the system log file.		|
	#|		|																										|
	#|		|																										|
	#|		\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	#|
	#|
	#|	Within the field display areas, we use a special character rendering method, so that we can see all of the 
	#|  specific control and whitespace characters that the A.I. is seeing and producing.  The following table shows
	#|	how this rendering is done:
	#|
	#|
	#|							Rendering as a single (usually black-on-red) 8-bit character.
	#|							|
	#|							|	Rendering as a single (usually black-on-red) 7-bit character.
	#|							|	|
	#|	 	Dec	Hex	Abb CC		8	7	Full name / description.
	#| 	 	---	--- ---	--		-	-	------------------------
	#|		 0	x00	NUL	^@		_	_	Null character.
	#|		 1	x01	SOH	^A		$	:	Start of heading (console interrupt?).

	#|		 3	x03	ETX	^C		»	]	End of text.
	#|		 4	x04	EOT	^D		.	.	End of transmission.
	#|		 5	x05	ENQ	^E		?	?	Enquiry (used with ACK).

	#|		 7	x07	BEL	^G		¢	*	Bell.
	#|		 8	x08	BS	^H		<	<	Backspace.
	#|		 9	x09	HT	^I		>	>	Horizontal tabulation [Tab]. (Whitespace; render as gray on black.)
	#|		10	x0A	LF	^J		/	/	Line feed [Enter]. (Whitespace; render as gray on black.)
	#|		11	x0B	VT	^K		v	v	Vertical tabulation. (Whitespace; render as gray on black.)
	#|		12	x0C FF	^L		§	V	Form feed. (Whitespace; render as gray on black.)
	#|		13	x0D CR	^M		®	<	Carriage return [Return]. (Whitespace; render as gray on black)
	#|		14	x0E SO	^N		(	(	Shift-out; begin alt. char. set.
	#|		15	x0F SI	^O		)	)	Shift-in; resume default char. set.
	#|		16	x10 DLE	^P		±	/	Data-link escape. (Like my command-line escape character.)
	#|		17	x11 DC1	^Q		°	o	Device control 1 (XON), used with XOFF.  Turn on/resume.  ('o' is for "on.")
	#|		18	x12 DC2	^R		©	@	Device control 2.  Special mode.
	#|		19	x13 DC3	^S		=	=	Device control 3 (XOFF), used with XON.  Secondary stop (wait, pause, standby, halt).
	#|		20	x14 DC4	^T		-	-	Device control 4.  Primary stop (interrupt, turn off).
	#|		21	x15 NAK	^U		¬	N	Negative acknowledgement. (N is for "No!")
	#|		22	x16	SYN	^V			~	~	Synchronous idle.	
	#|		23	x17	ETB	^W		;	;	End transmission block.
	#|		24	x18	CAN	^X		×	X	Cancel.
	#|		25	x19	EM	^Y		|	|	End of medium.

	#|		30	x1E	RS	^^		¶	&	Record separator. (And, here's another record!  Or, 'P' looks like an end-paragraph marker.)
	#|		31	x1F	US	^_		·	,	Unit separator. (In CSV, separates fields of a database row.)
	#|		32	x20	SP	^`		·	_	Space. (Whitespace; render as gray on black.)
	#|	   127	x7F	DEL	^?		#	#	Delete. (Looks like RUBOUT hash.)
	#|
	#|	For character codes from 128-255, we render them as above (but in a 
	#|	different color) if they are controls, and as themselves if they are 
	#|	printable Western font (Latin-1) characters.  For codes above 255, 
	#|	how we handle them is not really defined yet.  Maybe we just send 
	#|	them to the terminal unmodified, and just hope that they are 
	#|	supported.  This seems to work for characters up to 383 (ſ) in most 
	#|	fonts.

	#|	To implement the console, we will draw an arrangement of borders and

	#|	the display.

	#|	Most of the general infrastructure needed to implement a paneled display 
	#|	like this is provided in the display.panels module, but code specific to 
	#|	the console client in particular is gathered here in the console package.
