	MODULE NAME:	settings.settings
	IN PACKAGE:		settings
	FULL PATH:		$GIT_ROOT/GLaDOS/src/settings/settings.py
	MASTER REPO:	https://github.com/mikepfrank/GLaDOS.git
	SYSTEM NAME:	GLaDOS (General Lifeform and Domicile Operating System)
	APP NAME:		GLaDOS.server (Main GLaDOS server application)
	SW COMPONENT:	GLaDOS.settings (Settings management facility)


	MODULE DESCRIPTION:
	===================
	
		This Python module provides an implementation of the settings 
		management facility, one of the subsystems of the GLaDOS server.
		
		The purpose of the settings management facility is to provide the 
		underlying infrastructure that is required in order for the AI to 
		be enabled to browse and modify the settings of GLaDOS and its major
		subsystems within the 'Settings' GLaDOS app.
		
		The settings facility is intended to be initialized by a call to 
		the singleton class constructor TheSettingsFacility(), after config
		files are loaded but before any other subsystems are initialized.
		
		The facility maintains a hierarchy of "settings modules," rooted at
		the top-level module (singleton class) TheRootSettingsModule().
		
		As the various other subsystems of GLaDOS are created and initialized,
		they should each construct their own settings modules and Settings 
		objects, and insert them at the appropriate locations within the 
		existing settings module hierarchy.  Thus, after the system has 
		finished initializing, all of the settings modules will be in place. 
		
		The settings facility will eventually support a full suspend/resume
		capability, in which all settings are saved to a file when the system
		suspends operation, and reloaded when the system resumes operation.
		However, in general, suspend/resume is not implemented in GLaDOS yet.
	
	
	PUBLIC DEFINITIONS:
	-------------------
	
		TheSettingsFacility 								   [singleton class]
	
			This singleton class anchors the entire settings facility.  It
			should be initialized (after config files are loaded) by calling
			the class constructor TheSettingsFacility().  This initializes 
			a settings module hierarchy that is initially empty, except for 
			a root module _TheRootSettingsModule which is given appropriate
			name/description/docstring parameters.  After TheSettingsFacility
			has been initialized, other subsystems of GLaDOS may create their
			own settings modules, and plug them into the hierarchy.
			
		Setting 														 [class]
		
			GLaDOS subsystems should create subclasses/instances of this 
			class at initialization time to define their individual settings.  
			Subsystems should specify a hard-coded default value for each 
			setting, but (for configurable settings) should also reference 
			config values as needed to override the hard-coded defaults.
		
		SettingsModule													 [class]
		
			GLaDOS subsystems should organize their settings into "settings
			modules" which get installed into the hierarchical settings 
			module tree that is rooted at the root settings module.

	# An earlier file header comment block follows:
#|==============================================================================
#|	settings.py
#|
#|		This module defines a facility that provides organized access to 
#|		various system and application settings.  This faculity is utilized 
#|		by the 'Settings' GLaDOS app (defined in the 'apps' package).
#|
#|		The module is anchored in the singleton class TheSettingsFacility.
#|		The main class of the module is called SettingsModule, and it 
#|		provides essentially a 'directory' of related settings.  Instances 
#|		of SettingsModule can be nested inside of each other.  Each instance 
#|		has a short name \(identifier used in commands), a longer decription 
#|		used at the top of the headings window, and an even longer docstring.
#|
#|		The bottommost element in the settings hierarchy is called a Setting.  
#|		Each setting has a short name (identifier), a longer description, and 
#|		an even longer docstring.  It also has a SettingType_, and an iterable 
#|		ValueList (except for settings with very large or continuous ranges).
#|
#|		Settings types include the following (these are classes that should
#|		be instantiated as needed to set various type-specific parameters):
#|
#|			ToggleType		- Boolean value; toggle switch or checkbox.
#|			EnumeratedType	- Short enumerated list of possible values.
#|			RangeType		- Short range of integers.
#|			IntegerType		- Wide range of integers.
#|			ContinuousType	- Continuous ranges of numbers.
#|
#|		In the future, types may be associated with 'widgets' within the 
#|		settings app which are used to display/adjust their options.  (Or, is 
#|		this going overboard, perhaps?  Instructions to the AI may suffice.)
