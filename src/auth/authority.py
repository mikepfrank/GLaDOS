# Authority classes. Part of the authorization system for managing permissions.

#	Authority - An authority is an object that abstractly represents a given
#		set of capability access permissions; namely, whichever ones that have
#		been conferred upon this authority.  Entities may be granted authorities.
#		Authorities have inclusion relations.  Important singleton authorities 
#		include:
#
#			Null_Authority - This is a special authority that SHOULD NOT
#				BE GIVEN ANY PERMISSIONS WHATSOEVER.  Every authority 
#				automatically includes this authority.  This authority 
#				includes no other authorities.
#
#			Base_Authority - This is a special authority that is granted
#				to every entity that exists (or could possibly exist).
#				It only includes Null_Authority, and every other authority
#				(other than Null_Authority) implicitly includes this 
#				authority.
#
#			Generic_User_Authority - All entities that can be considered
#				GLaDOS users (whether human or AI) have this authority,
#				which gives them permission to access commands that are
#				intended to be accessible to all users.
#
#			AI_User_Authority - All AI personas have this authority, which
#				gives them permission to execute commands, modify settings
#				and files, and launch apps as per our intent for AI users.
#		
#			Human_User_Authority - All human users who are logged into the
#				system (whether locally or remotely) have this authority,
#				which grants them capabilities intended for human users.
#
#			Operator_Authority - The operator using the main server console
#				is granted this authority, which allows him/her to perform
#				actions intended for the system operator.  Operator authority
#				includes human user authority.
#
#			System_Authority - This is a special authority that is granted to
#				the entities representing automated subsystems of GLaDOS.  (Not
#				sure yet what we'll use it for.)
#
#			Omniscient_Authority - This is a special authority upon which we
#				automatically confer permission to access all 'passive' 
#				capabilities ('read', etc.) that exist in the system.
#
#			Omnipotent_Authority - This is a special authority upon which we
#				automatically confer permission to access all 'active' 
#				capabilities ('modify', etc.) that exist in the system.
#				
#			Godlike_Authority - Includes both the omniscient & omnipotent 
#				authorities.
#
#			Uber_Authority - This is a special authority which implicitly
#				includes *all* of the authorities that have been defined in 
#				the system.  It also implicitly has all possible permissions
#				conferred upon it.
