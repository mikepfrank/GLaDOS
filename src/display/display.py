	MODULE NAME:	display.display
	IN PACKAGE:		display
	FULL PATH:		$GIT_ROOT/GLaDOS/src/display/display.py
	MASTER REPO:	https://github.com/mikepfrank/GLaDOS.git
	SYSTEM NAME:	GLaDOS (General Lifeform and Domicile Operating System)
	APP NAME:		GLaDOS.server (Main GLaDOS server application)
	SW COMPONENT:	GLaDOS.display (Display screen management)


	MODULE DESCRIPTION:
	===================
	
		This module manages the "display screen," or virtual text terminal
		that is used to interact with human users.  
		
		This module is used by both the GLaDOS system console package, used 
		by system operators when monitoring the system, and by the terminal 
		package, which manages the individual sessions of users who are 
		connecting to the GLaDOS server, whether from another login session
		on the local host, or from a remote site.
		
		Presently, this module assumes that the actual terminal emulator that
		the human user is using is (more or less) compatible with xterm.  The
		Putty terminal used on Windows systems falls into this category.  
		Specifically, we assume that 64 color pairs and a Western/LATIN-1 font
		are available.  A future version of this module may generalize it to 
		a broader range of terminals.
		
		This module is based on the Python curses library.
		
	
	USAGE:
	------
	
		The primary means of utilizing the 'display' module is to subclass
		DisplayClient, and override the .paint() method for drawing the 
		display, and the .handle() method for handling input events.  Of 
		course, more complex, multi-window applications are possible.

		#|		Note that in the constructor call, if argument names
		#|		aren't given, then the y coordinate is specified first, 
		#|		as is standard within curses.

@singleton
class TheDisplay:
	"""
		TheDisplay										   [public anchor class]
		
			This is a singleton class which also serves as the public anchor
			point for the display module.
			
			Its sole instance represents the text display screen, which is 
			managed by the curses library.	 For now, it assumes that the 
			display is compatible with xterm/Putty (8 colors, Western script).
	
	
		Public data attributes (implemented as properties):
		----------------------
			
			display.{running, isRunning}			[boolean read-only property]
			
				True if the display is currently running (i.e., curses is
				in control of the text terminal).  Clients should not try
				to perform any display operations if the display is not in
				the running state (they will typically fail, or be ignored).
			
			display.client					  [DisplayClient read-only property]
			
				This is a handle to the currently active client (display-
				based application) that presently owns & controls the 
				display.  If it is None, no client is currently connected.
			
			display.screen			[curses top-level window read-only property]
			
				If the display is currently running, this is a handle to
				to the "screen" or top-level window of the curses display.
			
			display.{width, height}				  [integer read-only properties]
			
				These attributes return the current width (in assumed-
				fixed-with character columns) and height (in text rows) 
				of the text display.
			
			display.lock							  [RLock read-only property]
			
				This is a reentrant mutex lock, from the Python threading
				library, which controls access to sensitive data structures
				associated with the display (in particular, the state of 
				the curses library).  Before performing any operations that
				might affect the state of the display, one should grab this 
				lock using syntax like:
				
						with display.lock:
							...(do sensitive operations)...
				
				Note that this syntax will automatically take care of 
				releasing the lock when the code block is exited, even if
				this occurs via an exception.
				
			display.driver					  [DisplayDriver read-only property]
			
				An alternative method for performing thread-safe display 
				operations is to package the desired procedure into a 
				callable (e.g., a function, method, or anonymous delegate)
				and pass it to the display driver using any of the 
				following syntax patterns:
				
							
						dispDrvr(callable)
							# This form waits for completion, but discards 
							# any result.
				
						result = dispDrvr(callable)	
							# This form waits for completion and gets a result.
							
						dispDrvr.do(callable)
							# This runs the callable in the background by
							# adding it onto a queue of tasks to be executed
							# asynchonously by the display driver.
			
				Note that, behind the scenes, the display driver is imple-
				mented as an RPC- style Worker thread (from the infrastruc-
				ture.worklist module) whose assigned role is to interleave  
				and execute display-related operations coming from various
				source.  Before executing each task, the display driver 
				grabs the display.lock and makes sure that the display is
				actually running.  If not, the requested task is discarded.
				
				
		Public read-only methods:
		-------------------------
			
			display.get_size()						 [read-only instance method]
			
				Gets the current dimensions of the display in cells.
			
			display.get_max_yx()					 [read-only instance method]								
			
				Get the coordinates of the lower-right character cell.
		
		
		Public initialization methods:
		------------------------------
		
			display.setClient()					[instance initialization method]
			
				Tell the display what client will control it.
				
			display.start()							   [instance startup method]
			
				Starts the display running.  This launches a couple of
				threads (see the threads module) to handle display I/O.
		
		
		Sensitive public methods:
		-------------------------
		
			display.paint()								 [display driver method]
			
				Re-paints the entire display.
		
			[...CONTINUE...]

	def __init__(theDisplay:TheDisplay):

			theDisplay.__init__()					   [special instance method]
			
				This is the instance initializer for the sole instance of 
				the singleton class TheDisplay.  It is normally called for
				the first time by display.client.displayClient.__init__(), 
				when the first active client instance is created.
		
				The effect of this method is to initialize the display 
				system for later use.  However, not much can be done yet.
				We note that the display is not running yet, and initialize
				some private data members to null values to show that they
				are uninitialized.
				
				However, we do go ahead and create the display driver thread 
				(defined in the display.threads module) for later use.  But,
				when first created, it is just sitting idle and does nothing.

		#|----------------------------------------------------------------------
		#|	The first thing we do to initialize the display is to configure 
		#|	it to be in the input mode that we want.  We do this early on,
		#|	because we would like to suppress ordinary terminal control key 
		#|	processing, because we wish to handle these keys specially, in 
		#|	a way that is specific to our application.  (Especially ctrl-C, 
		#|	because we can't control which process/thread will see it, which 
		#|	introduces a lot of unnecessary extra complexity if we wanted to 
		#|	try to handle it cleanly.)  The ordinary controls that are being 
		#|	suppressed here are as follows:
		#|
		#|		^C (ETX)	-
		#|
		#|			This would normally cause a SIGINT (signal interrupt) 
		#|			signal to be sent to the process.  In Python curses 
		#|			programs, this would normally cause a KeyboardInterrupt 
		#|			exception to be raised, which would be fine, except that 
		#|			actually, the signal could end up getting caught by any 
		#|			of our subprocesses instead, and even if it's caught by 
		#|			the main process, the specific thread that it's raised 
		#|			within will be unpredictable.  Rather than having to 
		#|			figure out how to cope with all this unpredictability, 
		#|			we instead want to just handle interrupts manually, 
		#|			by e.g., binding a different key such as ^T (DC4) to a 
		#|			system-terminate behavior that we can handle cleanly.
		#|
		#|		^Q (DC1)	-
		#|
		#|			Also known as XON, this resumes a previously-suspended 
		#|			stream of data from the terminal.  However, XON/XOFF 
		#|			are extremely annoying controls, because it's very easy 
		#|			to hit ^S by accident, and then the terminal will seem 
		#|			to freeze up, and the user may not know to hit ^Q.
		#|
		#|		^S (DC3)	- 
		#|
		#|			Also known as XOFF; this is used in some protocols for 
		#|			flow control.  But in interactive user input, it's very
		#|			undesirable, because it causes the keyboard to appear 
		#|			to become unresponsive until a matching ^Q (XON) is
		#|			pressed.  We'd greatly prefer to just disable this 
		#|			antiquated, crappy-ass functionality altogether.
		#|
		#|		^Z (SUB)	-
		#|
		#|			In Unix systems, this tends to suspend the entire 
		#|			current process, and return the user to the shell 
		#|			prompt.  Again, although reversible ('fg' command) 
		#|			this behavior can be extremely disconcerting if the 
		#|			user hits the key by accident and isn't expecting it.  
		#|			So, we prefer to disable this functionality as well.
