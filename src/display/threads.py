	MODULE DESCRIPTION:
	===================
	
		This module defines two different, special threads that are 
		associated with operating the text terminal display:
		
			TUI_Input_Thread - A thread that is responsible for obtaining
								and dispatching on input from the user.

			DisplayDriver	- A worker thread that handles display output.
								Specifically, it executes all key handlers.
								Other threads may also asynchronously send 
								it output requests.

	#|
	#|		In this section, we define the threads that are provided by 
	#|		this module.  These include the following two threads:
	#|
	#|
	#|			TUI_Input	- Input thread for the Text User Interface.
	#|
	#|			DisplDrvr	- Display driver thread for the TUI.

		#|	TUI_Input									  [module public thread]
		#|
		#|		This thread is created and started up automatically by 
		#|		the display.start() method.  It immediately executes 
		#|		the display.run() method, which brings up curses and
		#|		calls the display._manage() method, which sets up the
		#|		display and enters the main input loop, which repeatedly
		#|		obtains input events (keypresses or resize events) and
		#|		dispatches to the appropriate event handlers.  
		#|
		#|		Keypress handlers, however, are handed off to the display
		#|		driver thread (see below) for execution; this allows them
		#|		to be interleaved with other display-related tasks that 
		#|		may be asynchronously requested by other threads.

		#|----------------------------------------------------------------------
		#|	DisplDrvr								  	  [module public thread]
		#|
		#|		This thread is created and started up automatically by 
		#|		the instance initializer for the singleton instance of
		#|		the 'TheDisplay' class.  It is a subclass of RPCWorker
		#|		(see infrastructure/worklist.py), which means that, if
		#|		passed a callable, it evaluates it and returns a result.  
		#|		Alternatively, one can call its '.do()' method to hand 
		#|		it a task to run asynchronously in the background.  Tasks
		#|		are normally executed first-come, first serve.
		#|
		#|		The display driver thread is invoked by the main loop to
		#|		handle all keypress events.  It may also be called by 
		#|		other asynchronously running threads, GLaDOS processes, 
		#|		and GLaDOS subsystems to update the display as needed.
