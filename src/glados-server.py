	FILE DESCRIPTION:
	=================

		This script constitutes the main server process executable for the
		GLaDOS system.	Within the OS process running this script, threads 
		are created to carry out the following functions (at the minimum):

				1. Primary "mind" thread for the A.I. itself.

				2. Various GLaDOS processes, which may include 'bridge' 
					processes for communicating to external systems (e.g.,
					Internet-based services), or to local resources (e.g., 
					Unix command prompt), or to internal subsystems of
					the GLaDOS system itself, such as the memory system,
					the settings interface, & the book authoring system.

				3. A thread for managing the text-based 'windowing' system
					inside of GLaDOS, which is the primary 'GUI' seen by 
					the A.I.  (The windowing system itself is not a GLaDOS
					process per se; it is used by the A.I. to interact 
					*with* GLaDOS processes.)
				
		For more details, please consult the README.md file within this
		directory and/or the contents of this program's major packages:
		
			* apps - Application system, and individual apps.
			
			* auth - Authorities or permissions system.
			
			* commands - Command interface system.
			
			* config - Configuration system.
			
			* console - Console user interface.
			
			* display - Display manager.
			
			* entities - Reification system.
			
			* events - Event records.
			
			* field - AI's receptive field (interface to AI).
			
			* gpt3 - API wrapper for the underlying OpenAI model.
			
			* helpsys - Interactive help system.
			
			* history - Cognitive history buffer facilty.
			
			* infrastructure - Reusable low-level modules.
			
			* memory - Long-term memory storage facility.
			
			* mind - AI's cognitive system.
			
			* processes - Wrapper layer for major subprocesses.
			
			* settings - For interactive control of settings.
			
			* supervisor - Major supervisory system of the OS.
			
			* terminal - For interacting with non-console users.
			
			* text - Low-level text buffer facility.

			* users - Support for AI and human users.
			
			* tokenizer - Local implementation of GPT tokenizer.

	#|
	#|	0. Preliminaries								   [module code section]
	#|	================
	#|
	#|		This section defines low-level debugging flags and optionally
	#|		displays some low-level debugging information prior to starting
	#|		the main program.
	#|
	#|		These flags are defined at the very top of the module so that we
	#|		can find and modify them quickly and easily during development.
	#|		(All other globals are defined later, in section 2.)
	#|
	#|		These are passed to the configLogMaster() function by the 
	#|		_initLogging() function defined in section 3.
	#|
	#|
	#|		RAW_DEBUG:bool							   [module global parameter]
	#|		--------------
	#|
	#|			Raw debugging flag for the current program.  This is a
	#|			very low-level feature, preliminary to any more sophi-
	#|			sticated diagnostic-logging capability.  The program 
	#|			code can check this flag before doing any low-level 
	#|			diagnostic output.  This then allows all such diagnostic 
	#|			output in this program to be easily suppressed by chan-
	#|			ging this flag to False.
	#|
	#|			Recommended value: False.
	#|
	#|
	#|		CONS_DEBUG:bool							   [module global parameter]
	#|		---------------
	#|
	#|			If this is True, then all debug-level (and higher) output 
	#|			sent to the infrastructure.logmaster module will also be 
	#|			displayed on the console.  Note this applies throughout the 
	#|			server application (not just in this main program).
	#|
	#|			Recommended value: False.
	#|
	#|
	#|		LOG_DEBUG:bool						   	   [module global parameter]
	#|		--------------
	#|
	#|			If this is True, then debug-level output sent to the 
	#|			infrastructure.logmaster module will be spooled out to
	#|			the system log file, '../log/GLaDOS.server.log'.  Note 
	#|			this applies throughout the server application, not just
	#|			in the current module.
	#|
	#|			Recommended value: False.
	#|
	#|
	#|		CONS_INFO:bool							   [module global parameter]
	#|		--------------
	#|
	#|			If this is True, then info-level output sent to the
	#|			infrastructure.logmaster module will be spooled out to
	#|			the system log file, '../log/GLaDOS.server.log'.  Note 
	#|			this applies throughout the server application, not just
	#|			in the current module.  Note that CONS_DEBUG effectively
	#|			implies CONS_INFO (and thus if CONS_DEBUG==True, then 
	#|			the actual value of CONS_INFO is effectively ignored).
	#|
	#|			Recommended value: False.
	#|
	#|vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

global RAW_DEBUG	# Raw debugging flag--controls low-level debug output for this module.
RAW_DEBUG = False	# Change this to True as needed during initial development.

	# The following flags control logging-level thresholds in the logmaster module.

global CONS_DEBUG, LOG_DEBUG	# These control debug-level output to console & log file.
CONS_DEBUG = False	# Tell logmaster: Don't diplay debug-level output on console.
LOG_DEBUG = True	# Tell logmaster: Do save debug-level output to log file.
#LOG_DEBUG = False	# Tell logmaster: Don't save debug-level output to log file.

global CONS_INFO	# This controls info-level output to console.

		#|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

		#|  Before doing anything else, we start a virtual terminal and have

			#|	terminals.  This facility is further organized into a "display" 
			#|	package which provides low-level display management, and a
			#|	"client" package that gives the application-specific functional-
			#|	ity.  In particular, the console client organizes the display 
			#|	into panels showing various information that would be of in-
			#|	terest to a human operator looking at the GLaDOS system console.
