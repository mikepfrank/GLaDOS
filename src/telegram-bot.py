"""
    This is a Telegram bot program for communicating with AI personas
    based on the GPT-3 neural network.  It is a side application of
    GLaDOS, Gladys' Lovely and Dynamic Operating System.

    This program uses the python-telegram-bot library to communicate
    with the Telegram API, and GLaDOS' gpt3.api module to communicate
    with the GPT-3 API.

    For each conversation, it keeps track of the messages seen so
    far in each conversation, and supplies the GPT-3 davinci model
    with a prompt consisting of the AI persona's persistent context 
    information, followed by the most recent N messages in the 
    conversation, each labeled with the name of the message sender, 
    e.g., 'Gladys>'.  Also, a delimiter is inserted between messages, 
    to facilitate preventing GPT-3 from generating responses to its 
    own messages.

    Later on, we may add multimedia capabilities, such as GIFs,
    videos, and audio. For now, we just use text.

    This program is designed to be run as a Telegram bot.  To run
    it, you must first create a bot account on Telegram.  Then,
    you must assign the environment variable 'TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN' 
    to the token for your bot account.  The token is given to you
    when you create your bot account.

    For more information on how to create a bot account on Telegram,
    please see: https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather.
