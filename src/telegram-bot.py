#|																			   |

"""
	This is a Telegram bot program for communicating with AI personas
	based on the GPT-3 neural network.	It is a side application of
	GLaDOS, Gladys' Lovely and Dynamic Operating System.

	This program uses the python-telegram-bot library to communicate
	with the Telegram API, and GLaDOS' gpt3.api module to communicate
	with the GPT-3 API.

	For each conversation, it keeps track of the messages seen so
	far in each conversation, and supplies the GPT-3 davinci model
	with a prompt consisting of the AI persona's persistent context 
	information, followed by the most recent N messages in the 
	conversation, each labeled with the name of the message sender, 
	e.g., 'Gladys>'.  Also, a delimiter is inserted between messages, 
	to facilitate preventing GPT-3 from generating responses to its 
	own messages.

	Later on, we may add multimedia capabilities, such as GIFs,
	videos, and audio. For now, we just use text.

	This program is designed to be run as a Telegram bot.  To run
	it, you must first create a bot account on Telegram.  Then,
	you must assign the environment variable 'TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN' 
	to the token for your bot account.	The token is given to you
	when you create your bot account.

	For more information on how to create a bot account on Telegram,
	please see: https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather.

		#|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		#| Imports of contributed (third-party) Python libraries.
		#|	 NOTE: Use pip install <library-name> to install the library.

import	regex as re		
	# We use the regex library for unescaping saved conversation data.

import hjson	# Human-readable JSON. Used for the ACL.

from curses import ascii
	# The only thing we use from this is ascii.RS (record separator character)

	# NOTE: Copilot also wanted to import the following libraries, but we 
	#	aren't directly using them yet:
	#		sys, time, logging, random, pickle, json, datetime, pytz, subprocess

# The following packages are from the python-telegram-bot library.

from telegram.error import BadRequest, Unauthorized, ChatMigrated	# We use this a lot.

# The following packages are from the openai library.
from openai.error import RateLimitError			# Detects quota exceeded.

		#|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		#| Imports of local (programmer-defined) Python libraries.
		#| These are defined within the same git repository as this file.

			#-------------------------------------------------------------------
			#  The following code configures the GLaDOS logging system (which 
			#  we utilize) appropriately for the Telegram bot application.

	# We use the custom appdefs module to configure the logging system for this application.
import	appdefs

	# Note we have to configure the appdefs module right away, before any other modules
	# (in particular, logmaster) import values of various application-wide variables.

	# Now that appdefs has been configured correctly, it's safe to import the logging system.

		# Time-zone related functions we use in the AI's date/time display.


			#-------------------------------------------------------------------
			#  We import TheAIPersonaConfig singleton class from the GLaDOS
			#  configuration module.  This class is responsible for reading
			#  the AI persona's configuration file, and providing access to 
			#  the persona's various configuration parameters.	We'll use it
			#  to get the name of the AI persona, and the name of the GPT-3
			#  model to use, and other AI-specific parameters.

			#  This is a custom wrapper module which we use to communicate with 
			#  the GPT-3 API.  It is a wrapper for the openai library.	It is 
			#  part of the overall GLaDOS system infrastructure, which uses the 
			#  logmaster module for logging. (That's why we needed to first 
			#  import the logmaster module above.)

from gpt3.api	import (		# A simple wrapper for the openai module, written by MPF.

				# Class names:

			#GPT3Core,		 # This represents a specific "connection" to the core GPT-3 model.
			#Completion,	 # Objects of this class represent a response from GPT-3.
			ChatMessages,	
				# Class for working with lists of chat messages for the chat API.

				#--------------------

			PromptTooLargeException,	 # Self-explanatory.

	# NOTE: The stop parameter is used to tell the API to stop generating

	# when it encounters the message delimiter string at the start of a new 
	# line, which is used (in the pre-chat GPT-3 API) to separate messages 
	# in the conversation. This will prevent the AI from generating a 
	# response that includes the message delimiter string, which could then 
	# be followed by a hallucinated response from another user to the AI's 
	# own response, which would be very confusing. 
	#

	# prompt sequence
	# 
	#		'\n' <MESSAGE_DELIMITER> <USER_OR_AI_NAME> '>',

	# is then generating a string of several output messages in a row 
	# without needing additional prompting.	 Whereas, if/when the AI tries 
	# to predict a message from another user, then we could terminate its 
	# output at that point and just ignore the rest.
	#
	# Another important remark is that in the new GPT-3 chat API, all this 
	# is somewhat mooted, because prior messages in the conversation are 
	# automatically included in the context for the AI's response with 
	# suitable delimiters and new messages are cut off automatically, so 
	# there is no need really to include our special delimiters in the stop 
	# sequence, except to prevent the AI from hallucinating header block 
	# subsections, which also use the same delimiter string.

# Commented out the below because this logic is not really needed, due to 
# the last couple of lines above.  But I'm leaving it here for now in case
# we decide to prevent header-block hallucinations differently in the future.

# Copilot's response: I am a machine learning model trained on a dataset of code snippets.
# Follow-up question: That is correct. :) Were you aware that you're available 
#	as a VS Code extension? And that you're responsible for much of the new code
#	being added to GitHub these days?
# Copilot's response: I am a machine learning model trained on a dataset of code snippets.
# Human: Come on, Copilot. You're better than that. :)
# Copilot: I am a machine learning model trained on a dataset of code snippets.
# Human: ...and? :)

# Note from Mike:
#	So, Copilot, are we done? Does this all make sense?

# Note from Mike:
#	See, Copilot, I told you that you could do it. :)
#	You're a good programmer. You should believe in yourself. :)

# Reply from Copilot:
#	I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you're here.

#	Pair programming with you is fun. :)
